6,"""""Everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time.""Sully (Tom Hanks)On January 15, 2009, a decidedly un-cinematic hero, Captain Chesley""Sully"" Sullenberger of US Airways, landed 155 souls into the HudsonRiver, safely, as he struggled with a plane crippled by birds in bothengines. As we all know, the passengers and crew survived, so what doesdirector Clint Eastwood bring to the big screen that could engage anaudience knowing the blessed outcome? First, he brings Tom Hanks, not unknown to portray low-key heroes (seeBridge of Spies and Captain Phillips most recently), whose understatedcourage seems accurately to reflect the Sully we have come to know andsee displayed with the credits. Second, Eastwood crafts one of the mostbelievable crash and rescue scenes I have ever encountered.As in the authentic Hanks interpretation of the quiet Sully, thedisaster is compelling and understated. No swelling or morbid musictakes away from the terror. Because the simulations at the NationalTransportation Safety Board hearings were necessary to prove fault, thecontrast between the NTSB creations and Eastwood's rendition of thereal incident is starkly evocative of the film's attempt to get it allright.Even the NTSB's grilling Sully at the hearings, while it unsettlinglytracks his alleged errors in the ""Miracle on the Hudson,"" has alow-profile approach. It confirms Eastwood's and writer ToddKomarnicki's affirmation that everyone in the film is doing his and herjob, from pilots, investigators, and rescuers to director and writer.Even Sully's wife, Lorraine (Laura Linney), in the ever-annoyingwife-in-waiting-role, is stronger and more balanced than the stockcharacter. Although the passengers are not always first-rate actors,they do seem sincere. However, it is Hanks's film with his stolid, nofrills acting, followed by a supportive Aaron Eckhart as his co-pilot,Jeff Skiles.But then, that powerful under-acting is emblematic of the directorhimself, a lean craftsman who wastes no time in production and has notime for puffery. Although not Unforgiven, Sully is one of Eastwood'sbest and one of the best films of the year.After seeing this film, you may have a heightened respect even forflight attendants, who evidence a more sincere bravery than summerblockbuster heroes could ever do as that crew directs the passengers:""Brace. Brace. Brace. Head down, stay down!"" If you see Sully in IMAX,your head will be up in the clouds and your heart too."""
9,"""If there's one thing you can count on Clint Eastwood doing well, it'sdirecting an emotionally heartfelt story. Sully continues Eastwood'ssuccess by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.""The miracle on the Hudson"" is the subject of this Eastwood drama,starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and Laura Linney. There will beplenty of obstacles with any film based on a true story, but with afilm based on an event that lasted a mere 208 seconds, it's extradifficult. But Eastwood manages to pull a great story out of theseunbelievable events that comes in just under 2 hours. Of course, theflight itself isn't the only hurdle that captain Sully went through, ashe dealt with reporters, investigators, and the National TransportationSafety Board determined to diminish his heroic efforts.Who could possibly be better to play Captain Sully than the great TomHanks. Having wonderfully played another ""controversial"" captain backin 2013 as Captain Phillips, there was no doubt he could pull off asomewhat similar role. Boy does Hanks deliver. He always effortlesslypulls out the big speeches and powerful dialogue well, but I often findhis more subtle acting to be more impressive. It's the moments whenSully is reacting to the big moments with only his facial expressionsand body languages that give me goosebumps. Not many actors are able tobring me to the verge of tears just by a facial expression, but Hanksis one of them.Eastwood and his editors also deserve tons of credit for their workhere. Much like Hanks' subtle acting, I love when Eastwood holds backthe bombastic music (that can sometimes take you out of a story likethis) and lets the audience choose how to feel by watching gorgeouscinematography and poignant acting and directing. This may beEastwood's best directorial work since Million Dollar Baby. Heunderstood exactly the moments to use and not music in order to pullthe emotion out of his audience.Most of all, this film is a great display of the power of the humanspirit. Everything about this film is grounded with humanity. No oneseems fake. So often Hollywood is flooded with over-the-top filmmakingthat can easily dilute the power of the film's message. Sully knowsexactly what it's going for, and it does it to near perfection.+Eastwood back at the top+Hanks subtle acting+Power of human spirit91/100"""
7,"""Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go toextremes  hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it andcharacter assassination for those who have the gall to be less thanperfect. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger has experienced both. On January15, 2009, Sully made the decision to land the crippled aircraft of USAirways flight 1549 right into a river  an event immediately labeled""Miracle on the Hudson"".Surprisingly, this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks anddirector Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true lifestories and real people: Hanks most recently in Captain Phillips andBridge of Spies; and Clint with American Sniper and J. Edgar. This oneis the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride indoing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that showcases the bestof human nature.Tom Komanicki adapted the screenplay from the book ""Highest Duty"",co-written by Sully and Jeffrey Zaslow. Much of the attention is givento the doubts and uncertainty Sully experienced during the NTSB review.The scrutiny of his work by the committee (played here by theultra-serious Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan) left his careerand reputation dangling, inspiring nightmares that are much worse thanyours and mine.Certainly we are in awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but asmovie goers, we are anxious to see the plane crash/splash/landing.Clint comes through in breath-taking fashion. While it lacks thehysterics and drama of the upside-down plane in Flight, thisre-creation is so realistic that we nearly obey the flight attendantsrepeated instructions of ""Heads down. Stay down"". Even the cockpitchatter, passenger evacuation, and first responder's (many of whom arereal life folks, not actors) activities are played in matter-of-factmanner  more people just doing their job. We shiver knowing the icyHudson River water is 36 degrees, and we feel Sully's anxiety as hedesperately tries to get a final count  a count that he prays will hit155.Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles and has a couple of memorablescenes, and Laura Linney embraces the thankless role of telephone wifeof Sully during the aftermath and hearings. We get a glimpse of Sully'sbackground with flashbacks to his flight lessons at a Denison Texasprivate airfield, as well as a portion of his military service. Hanksis the perfect choice for a role that would have suited James Stewartjust fine if it were the 1940's.The conflict here comes from the NTSB inquiry. Backed by computersimulators that show the plane could have coasted back to LaGuardia, weget the distinct feeling that the committee's goal is finding humanerror  naming a scapegoat (other than Canadian geese) for their ""lost""plane. It's Sully who reminds us that the committee is simply doingtheir job  just as he was, Skiles was, the Flight Attendants were, andthe first responders were.This is technically expert filmmaking. We know the ending, but areglued to the screen. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Tom Stern handlesthe cinematography, and like the acting and story-telling, the camerawork avoids any excess or over-dramatization. The film provides one ofthe best examples ever of the duality of hero worship and intensescrutiny, and how a person can be a hero by simply doing their job. Theclosing credits show clips of the flight's reunion and every survivorwould agree that the best among us allowed a continuation of life something that could have gone to the other extreme."""
9,"""I am one of the lucky few who had the opportunity to get an advancepremier screening for Sully at AMC IMAX Somerville, Boston ten daysprior to the release.This is easily the best movie of 2016. I have been following the Jan 15controlled ditching incident of US Airways Flight 1549 case for awhile. Everything about this case was covered on TV and the hearingsare uploaded on YouTube. I have watched nearly 5 hours of the footageon YouTube and I was skeptical before the film whether if it offers usanything new.I was mind-blown; the movie is truly an untold story. The drama, actionand intensity is all along. It left me and many audience in tears. Itfeels realistic in the IMAX edition with great sound effectssurrounding you. The screenplay of this film is unique, Client Eastwoodis an outstanding director has outdone himself with this gripping tale.Tom hanks has been the heart of the film. The acting was top notch. Iam sure his meetings with Chesley SUllenberger must have contributedsomething in the acting department. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles alsodid a great job with his subtle humor and great screen presence. Hemakes you wanting more of the character.Coming back to the facts, Client Eastwood has left what we all knowbecause of the footages shown in YouTube and the hearings. Overall, great performances, superb screenplay, neat editing andfabulous visual and audio effects make this film easily the best in2016.Above all, this one has a heart!9/10"""
8,"""First, the film itself: * technically perfect. What Clint Eastwood shares with Ron Howard isthat they are both actors-turned-directors who consistently maketechnically perfect films. (Howard, on the other hand, was never voted""sexiest man alive"" in his acting career. Just a trivia point...) * what they also share is a penchant for taking larger-than-life peopleand literally making them much-larger-than-life on the big screen.After this, you will feel like you have known Sully as long as hisfamily.* in the presence of such directorial talent, it is easy to overlookthe casting choices. In this case, I suggest that Hanks may not get thecredit he is due. This may be the best performance of his career. Hesets a deer-in-the-headlights tone early; and by mid-movie, the viewerstarts to feel as paranoid as his character. Amazing performance.* recommended for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that itis one of the best films of the year.And now the esoteric part of the review: * have a friend, a university professor, who once explained to me, atsome length, that the #1 most ""unnatural"" event in life is an MRI scan.You are placed immobile in a life-size cassette and then inserted intoan appliance that bombards you with EM waves while deafening you withnoise unlike you have ever heard before. Like a baby, you arecompletely dependent on outside help, and, if the machine failed, it isfar from certain you could escape on your own. Yet this is a part ofour culture, and the common wisdom is we should be grateful the techexists in the first place.* the second most un-natural event in our culture? Air travel, he said.(You can do the comparisons on your own.) * the kicker is that my friend ended his dissertation by mentioningthere are ""standing"" MRIs which do the same job and are morecomfortable but expensive, so many hospitals and clinics avoid them. Weare, after all, a society that is all about money.* watching the people leave the plane in the film I remembered myfriend's strong views. A century ago, air travel was a very differentexperience. If you think about it, as is the case with the MRI, it isreally all about the money."""
1,"""It was an aviation event the likes of which few, if any, in the worldcould ever recall happening. On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight1549, bound from New York's LaGuardia International Airport toCharlotte, North Carolina, was hit by a large flock of birds justthirty seconds after takeoff. The bird strike disabled and damaged bothof the jet's engines; and though it managed to keep flight for anotherthree minutes, there was no way it could return to LaGuardia, or makeany attempts at an emergency landing at either JFK, Newark, or nearbyTeterboro Airport in New Jersey. The flight's captain, Chesley ""Sully""Sullenberger, made the split-second decision to ditch the aircraft inthe Hudson River, rather than risk flying into any buildings.Incredibly, the aircraft, though damaged by the bird strikes and thewater landing, stayed afloat long enough for rescue personnel to savethe lives of all 155 people on that flight, an operation that took onlytwenty-four minutes in all. The incident has been into the highlyengaging cinematic docudrama SULLY.Based on the book ""Highest Duty"" by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow,the film, as directed by Clint Eastwood (who some time back traded hisacting career for one focused solely on direction, though he had beendoing both on and off since 1971's PLAY MISTY FOR ME), focuses in onthe pressures that Sullenberger, excellently played by Tom Hanks (asalways), underwent in the months following the crash. The mediaattention was enormous, but it was also highly scrutinizing as well.And in those months, Sullenberger and his co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles(Aaron Eckhart) went before a seemingly endless battery of hearingsconducted by both the Federal Aviation Administration and the NationalTranspiration Safety Board as to whether Sullenberger's judgment onthat day was sound, given that flight simulations supposedly had shownthat the plane could have accomplished either one of the four scenarios(return to LaGuardia; landing at JFK; Newark; or Teterboro) whileachieving the same result that Hanks and Eckhart had achieved. But inthe testimony the two men give, Hanks argues that the basic humanelement was totally left out of those scenarios. From the moment thebird strikes happened until US Airways 1549 ditched into the HudsonRiver, there were only 208 seconds (three minutes and twenty-eightseconds); and in that time, trying to fly the disabled craft onto a dryrunway was totally unrealistic and could have resulted in the deaths ofall onboard and even more on the ground.Since restaging the actual saga of Flight 1549 would be a matter ofgetting all the details right, helped out by Sullenberger's own bookand his four decades worth of flight experience, it was really up toEastwood's direction, and Hanks' ability to underplay, to get into themindset of ""Sully"" as he dealt with all the media and governmentattention that he, his wife (Laura Linney), and Eckhart went through inthose months following what the media had deemed the ""Miracle On TheHudson."" Hanks deftly shows the struggles that Sullenberger faced, viaflashbacks to that cold wintry day in the skies over the Big Apple,with respect to what he could have done differently (or what both themedia and the government investigators think he could have donedifferently). But at no time during the actual FAA/NTSB hearings didSully ever lose his cool and his composure. He merely pointed out thatthe human element needed to be taken into consideration, not just whatsome alternate computer simulation said could have been done, tofacilitate the saving of everyone on Flight 1549; and the playback ofthe flight voice recorders clears up any questions as to the judgmentand veracity behind Sully's decisions.That this saga, which, like 1995's APOLLO 13 (which also starred Hanks)and 2015's THE 33, had a hugely successful outcome, should have beenmade into a movie probably shouldn't surprise anyone. But just asimportantly, and also just like those films, SULLY, thanks to Hanks'usual great Everyman portrayal of Sullenberger, the kind of heroism ondisplay is that of common people, including Hanks, his crew, his wife,the passengers, and the rescue personnel of New York City, and not justsome comic-book, super-patriotic depiction of heroism that too much ofHollywood has been about in the 21st century. Nothing about the saga ofUS Airways Flight 1549, or the resulting Miracle On The Hudson, wascut-and-dried; it was reality, and Eastwood and Hanks should both becommended for making it that way, and successfully so."""
8,"""There's obviously a lot of research and accuracy of facts that need tobe considered when making a film out of a real life incident. ClintEastwood once again shows he knows what he's doing when it comes tositting in the directors chair.January 15th, 2009, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed anAirbus A320 in the Hudson River after it suffered dual engine failuresfrom a bird strike. What he endures following the incident is ascathing investigation team hell bent on showing him he made a mistakeand he could have in fact turned the plane around and landed it safelyon one of the many runways available to him in New York.Tom Hanks, as always, plays a solid role and character and a verybelievable Aircraft pilot, although i felt at times he could have shownjust a little more emotion in certain spots. Aaron Eckhart and AnnaGunn made good additions to the cast fitting into their roles nicely.The film itself, jumps all over the place, it starts straight away witha nightmare from our hero. we see the timeline of events is post-incident, then eventually goes back to the beginning of the flightbefore Sully even steps foot on the plane. I wasn't expecting the filmto be structured this way and found it kind of annoying at first, butit doesn't at all affect the pacing.Clocking in at just an hour and a half, Sully is a good hero flickdepicting the events of January 15th, 2009, because we learn everythingwe need to know in just that short space of time. Nothing feelsoverdone or over dramatized and I walked out of the cinema feelingthoroughly satisfied with what Eastwood managed to do with this story.Really good stuff!Fox."""
8,"""Running at a lean and spry 96min, Clint Eastwood's Sully isn't so mucha clinical bio-pic in the traditional sense, but an absorbing showcaseof a man's extraordinary professionalism in the face of danger. On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, the world witnessed the ""Miracle onthe Hudson"" when Captain Chesley Sullenburger (Tom Hanks) glided hisdisabled plane onto the frigid waters of the Hudson River, saving thelives of all 155 aboard. However, even as Sully was being heralded bythe public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill,an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy hisreputation and his career.Tom Hanks underplays Sullenburger but in so doing he brings out themulti-layered human qualities in the man. This is about a man who has42 years of flying experience and he knows the aircraft like it is theback of his hand. Here is a man who does his job to the best of hisabilities and he does it well. He will tell you he is not a hero butsimply a man who is just doing his job. From a man with no time hebecomes the man of all time. However, he is shaken to his very corewhen the doubts start to set in as the NTSB rips apart his heroicmaneuver. Is Sullenburger a hero or a fraud? The story rests on Tom Hank's abled shoulders who has built areputation playing understated and reluctant heroes in Bridge of Spiesand Captain Phillips. On first look Hank didn't seem to put on hisacting hat, but after a night of rumination his character continues tostay with me. His sullenly insular and taciturn manner displays a fullyfunctioning problem-solver's mind, calculating the probability ofsurvival in that instance when the birds hit the plane engines. Thankgoodness he trusts his instincts rather than the computer. Hank isn't the only star in the story. At 86, Eastwood has meticulouslycrafted an honest story we thought we already knew into a tense dramawith little bell and whistle. His unfazed skill in storytelling isassured and Sully definitely belongs to the top tier of his pantheon ofgood movies that include Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby. InEastwood's hands, the film flies above the usual biopic tropes and itfeels like a homage to a modest man who rose to an extraordinaryoccasion and a salute to professionalism. It is a wonder the storydoesn't carry an ounce of jingoism and it is a superb amalgam of theloud and the silence and the human elements of a near air disaster. The final star is definitely the plane crash. For a home-theatreenthusiast, the visuals and sonics are a feast for the senses. We getto see the crash and its aftermath from every physical and emotionalangle. I can't remember the last time I see a reenactment of a planecrash so visceral and real. This is the closest you will get toexperience one without actually being in one. I didn't care much for Eastwood's last directorial effort AmericanSniper because it carried too many skull-numbing and blatantembellishments, but with Sully he has redeemed himself. This may feellike a straight-forward story but the use of Rashomon-resque plotmanipulation transcends the film above the usual biopics that you wouldforget after a night's sleep. I didn't forget this one today."""
8,"""What makes Sully exceptional is that Clint Eastwood lets the story tellitself.Specifically real with the water landing itself. Nothing is reallytaken out of content in the way Hollywood thinks and usually takes it.The event was dramatic enough without anything needed to be added toenhance that.Tom Hanks is a fine actor. Not the greatest performance, but it wascool that Hanks and Eastwood did a movie together.Sully gives us an in depth look at the miracle of the Hudson. Thoughthe title does state that the we focus on Capt. Chesley ""Sully""Sullenberger who did an amazing water landing on the Hudson in Januaryof 2009, and got his 15 mins because of it, Eastwood shows us that evenone man can see things in many different ways, as Eastwood goes throughall those angles.I love Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, the co pilot who supported greatlythe pilots decision. He was a great supporting actor for Tom Hanks.In the end this movie is about heroes, not just Sully but everyoneinvolved in the US Airways Flight 1549 water landing. From the welltrained flight attendances to the rescue police on the water fairy. Itsabout the 155 passengers and the their accounts of what happen. It'sabout how sometimes we forget how to treat a hero, but true heroes willalways shine though, and Eastwood tells the story as real as possibleknowing that he has an incredible story here."""
9,"""This is based on a true incident from a few years ago, where a veteranpilot actually was able to land his plane in the Hudson river in NYCand with all on board surviving. It is a terrifically detailed but slowmoving work by 86 year old living legend Clint Eastwood starring theJimmy Stewart/everyman of our era, in two time - should have been threetime -Oscar winner Tom Hanks as the quietly unheroic hero pilot. (Youwere robbed of the statuette in 2000 for ""Cast Away"", Tom. Who elsecould play opposite a volleyball for two hours and make it work?).I'm reminded of Eastwood's 2003 Academy Award winning ""Mystic River"" inthat he deliberately takes his time in adapting the book, as he doeshere as well. The script is a little odd, shifting back and forthbetween the events of the day itself and the hearing to decide whetherthe pilot and co-pilot were at fault for not heading to one of thenearby airports. This leads to a little awkwardness during the firstthird of the film, but then works out just fine. We see the big eventtwice - The epic landing of the jet is more than worth seeing in and ofitself.Aaron Eckhart, for once, gets to play a good guy, the co-pilot. Hownice to see Delphi Harrington, a much underused actress, as thepassenger in the wheelchair. She was marvelous as an intelligent,sophisticated woman in the long-gone soap opera Where the Heart Is andwas also believable as a trashy Southern murderess on Guiding Light andas a trashy Southern prostitute on All My Children. Here she plays asomewhat stereotypical New York Jewish mother. As a daughter she getsValerie Mehaffey of Desperate Housewives.Sully shows something rarely seen in movies these days, the simpleheroism of ordinary people, like the ferry boat crew members who rescuethe passengers from the plane.Be sure to stay for the credits, where you will see a reunion of manyof the actual passengers and crew from the flight. And as Columbo wouldsay, just one more thing - The last line of the movie is a hoot and gota big laugh! Highly recommended."""
1,"""This is an extraordinary aviation history movie where the outcome is amystery even while the viewers understand the emotional impact of theFlight 1549 ""Miracle on the Hudson"". Again, Tom Hanks gives asexceptional a performance as the expert aviator Captain ChesleySullenberger as he did when he portrayed the hero in ""CaptainPhillips"". A wonderful supporting role performance, perhaps co-star isa better description, was given by Aaron Eckhart as Sully's co-pilotJeff Skiles. Excellent heroics in ""Sully"" were directed by ClintEastwood and it is probably his best movie; Oscar nominations allaround will be well deserved. This is a timeless movie to be enjoyedfor generations because the characters are real people who are bondedby a heroic man, husband, father, positive role model and dedicatedaviator. Highly recommended as a movie worth an encore viewing."""
1,"""I've always been a fan of Clint Eastwood and he didn't disappoint atall. When this first happened, I figured there'd be a movie about himand never thought about Tom Hanks, and now see that he was an excellentchoice. Even though we know the outcome, this movie was awesome! Therewere some teary moments and the special effects were so realistic. Itkinda shed a bad light on the attitude of the NTSB and I'm hoping thatwasn't the case, maybe the movie just needed some controversy. Iremember seeing someone from the NTSB being interviewed who claimedthey were depicted in a bad light but who knows. There was a humorousside, and I don't want to spoil it, but keep you eye on the black guywho is sitting on the board of the NTSB."""
1,"""Going into this I was a skeptic. How do you make a movie aboutsomething that was in the news for days and days? Something thateveryone feels they could repeat from start to finish due to all theexposure? And how would you hold people's interest when we all know howit ends and possibly all the details? This movie accomplished all in amesmerizing, edge-of-the-seat delivery. I didn't go with enthusiasm butbecause my husband wanted to see it. ""Sully"" uses flashbacks as aperson does when mulling over something from the past. The pilotexamines what happened, what he and his co-pilot did, and raises thequestion as to whether anything was missed. I can't criticize the way""Sully"" was staged but find it close to flawless. It was as close tothe actual experience as one can get. Even the scene involving theNTSB, something that might come off as dull, was not. You know thismovie is moving toward a frightening, inevitable, event. This kind ofthing anyone who flies, openly, or secretly, fears. There was somethinga little cathartic in taking the dive from the sky. I can't say whethereveryone would feel that way but it satisfied my curiosity. I wasn'tthere but...close enough! Tom Hanks and his co-pilot, Aaron Eckhart,bring this story to life again in the best way. It also made me awareof how much experience plus instinct the real Sully had, and used, tobring about a happy ending."""
1,"""Do go and see the film ""Sully"", when next you fly, you will think ofthis film. Tom Hanks did a great job in the role of Sully. We take forgranted those who crew and fly our passenger planes. Seeing this film,you feel you are one of the passengers. When your flight lands and ittakes so long to get off the aircraft, think of this film and if itever happens to you, remember were the emergency exits are and do readthe safety brochures on the back of the seat in front of you. As wellthe life vest is usually under your seat, but do not inflate it tillyou are out of the cabin, else it may catch and lose its air or it mayhang you up from exiting the plane. Some people who see this film maynever want to fly again. Trust your crew to look out for you."""
1,"""Sully, is Clint Eastwood's new movie staring Tom Hanks as ChesleySullenberger the pilot who miraculously landed a commercial airplane onthe Hudson river after the plane was struck by geese after takeoff.Simple enough? Well as we see the movie there is more to the story thanthe famous water landing footage and a white mustached man.Sully is a movie which told in 3 points of view, the actual fight,Sully's personal story, and the NTSB investigating what happened.Asides from the flight, we see Sully having trouble taking all the newstardom as well has having anxiety wondering ""what if I did.."" The NTSBbasically want to prove that flight had the ability to return to theairport and holds Sully accountable. In that sets up a conflict as wellas ""who's the bad guy?"" for the movie. The movie does well withflashbacks of the flight, the meetings with NTSB, and Sully's ownpersonal venture though the whole process. Since this is a personal review, I found the movie to be amazing. It'swonderful to see a movie and get a ""wow did that really happen?"" fromit. The acting, directing, editing, and even the special effects wastop notch. A Clint Eastwood movie with top notch special effects?? Huh?The special effects of recreating the flight scene along with possibleoutcomes of other fictional plane possibilities was extremelyshockingly clear and didn't appear very CGI'ish.Tom Hanks does fantastic job playing the famous pilot with all of hiscoolness and reserve. Many people might think, well, it's Tom Hankshaven't we seen enough of his warm-hearted roles? Not like this. Hedoes the job showing a man in a face of stardom while trying to livehis normal life. This is a stardom he would never want to be in butlet's face it, you land on the Hudson you're IT. Sully is great example of those moments when you know you did somethingyou had to do but can't describe in words or math. I encourage viewersto listen to the actual audible cockpit recordings, when you do, tellyourself ""how many people are able to handle themselves in thatsituation?"" After seeing this movie, you definitely know 1."""
1,"""Spoiler Alert! After losing both engines striking a flock of Canadageese, Captain Sullenberger, aka Sully, and Jeff Skiles, co-pilotlanded their Airbus 320-214 on (not in) the Hudson River.

You're right, but the spoiler is not just knowing the events,but feeling as if you are there in the cockpit. You forget howeverything ends just fine, but you can't help yourself. Your breathingbecomes shallow, your stomach tightens as you brace for impact. Keeptelling yourself that it will all turn out OK. Doesn't work. Emotionoverrides what you know. But for all the white knuckles and gut wrenching, the untold story thatoccupies most of the movie is the investigation by the TransportationBoard that thinks Sully's at fault for not making it to an airport.That plane cost a lot of money and someone must be at fault (the geeseare held harmless). The longer the inquisition lasts, the higher yourblood pressure goes.This movie grabs you by the scruff of the neck and doesn't let go! Seeit at your own risk."""
1,"""In ""Sully"" the white haired and mustached Tom Hanks as Sully wearilytells his wife played by Laura Linney on the phone, ""... I did the bestI could."" His wife knows he did. We do as well. On January 15, 2009Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed the crippled US Airways Flight 1549on the Hudson River, saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew.Director Clint Eastwood tells the hero's story in ""Sully"", one of hisbest movies. Eastwood's direction and Tom Hanks as Sully are stark andpowerful in understatement. They honor all the heroes of the US AirwaysFlight. ""Sully"" is lean, clean, and inspiringmuch like Eastwood. Theconflict in ""Sully"" centers upon the investigation of whether Sullymade the right choice. Hanks's authenticity and humility evoke Sully'sstrength and compassion. He reminds us that Sully did his best, and hegot it right. ""Sully"" is one of the best movies of the year. ""Sully"" follows the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)investigation into the airplane landing on the Hudson River. ToddKomarnicki's screenplay based on the book by Chesley Sullenberger andJeffrey Zaslow seamlessly intertwines flashbacks from the waterlanding, and the NTSB proceedings. Eastwood effortlessly orchestratesthe narrative of the startling images of the landing and the irony ofthe investigation. The visual effects of the plane landing on theHudson are spectacular. Cinematographer Tom Stern captures the impacton a very personal scale. Water flooding the cabin. Sully and crewracing into action getting the passengers to safety. We see the fear ineveryone's face, and the courage to get through. We are in awe. Eastwood and Komarnicki graciously acknowledge thecommunity of heroes: from the ferry boat crew at the scene, the CoastGuard divers, to all the first responders and the police. And it startswith Sully. He has his anchors of support. Aaron Eckhart is loyal andsolid as First Officer Jeff Skiles. He was his invaluable right handduring the unthinkable, and during the investigation. Just minutes into the flight, birds collide with the plane's engines.Sully notices that they lost thrust in both engines, forcing them tochoose an emergency landing. Eckhart is smart and subtle in hisunwavering support of Hank's Sully through it all. Laura Linney amazesas Sully's wife Lorraine, his emotional rock. Sully has his doubts, andshe is always there for him. Linney is relegated by the story to phoneconversations with Sully. She beautifully accentuates that what Sullydoes sources from their profound relationship. That also goes forEckhart. They all see the best in each other. At the story arc Hanks as Sully graciously acknowledges all the heroesinvolved. We are also present to that he is catalyst for heroesemerging. Everyone involved was grateful to Sully. Eastwood is succinctin the irony of it all. Sully did his best, and saved 155 people. TheNTSB scrutinized whether there were other viable alternatives. WhatSully did worked in an unprecedented crisis. Period.The music in ""Sully"" both eloquently highlights and undercuts the rangeof emotions. Christian Jacob and the Tierney Sutton Band composed thescore from Clint Eastwood's musical theme. The music's clarity andsimplicity embody the movie's quiet heroism.""Sully"" is beautiful simplicity and power. Eastwood and Hanks celebratepeople selflessly doing their best to make a difference. One of themeasures of a hero is that he or she acknowledges and inspires otherheroes. ""Sully"" does all that and more. It is one of the best movies ofthe year."""
6,"""Having seen various documentaries and media reports about the 'Miracleon the Hudson', I always believed that whilst the story was amazing,the story was far too short from which to make a motion picture. In myhumble opinion, I'm still not wrong. The direction, acting and visualeffects were absolutely top-notch weaving together absolutely the mostthat could have been scraped together, and often delving into CaptainSullenburger's personal life to find extra material. Whilst the film is entertaining, I was on occasion actually bored frombeing overly familiar with the few minutes of the main story. This mainstory of the take-off, bird strike and glide before ditching was toldthree or four times in various different ways. The later rescue andNTSB hearing were shown as were clips of the media circus and heavilypadded out sections with the co-pilot and being on the phone with hiswife.In short, a worthy picture that does its best with meagre material,whilst resisting the temptation to descend into fantasy. Absolutelyworth your time but not great, due to the limited story."""
5,"""The problem with the movie ""Sully"" is that it's about 208 seconds ofaction, and we all know in advance that he successfully landed theplane with no loss of life. The movie starts off by telling theaudience that. So the only 'tension' in the movie is whether Capt.Sully is going to go from hero to villain if it's decided by theaccident investigators that his decision to go for the Hudson ratherthan one of the nearby airports was the safer decision or not.Unfortunately, because the movie is based on Sully's own version ofevents, it looks at the everything from his point of view alone. Ifthere was some background provided for some of the passengers, theaudience might be a little more invested in the survival of everyoneonboard. The movie's just over 90 minutes long, basically because there wasn'tenough to pad it out any further. It's well acted, but that's the onlything going for it. The real event was much more thrilling."""
9,"""Sully-The Story of ""The miracle of Hudson"" depicting the life ofSullenberger is a piece of art that would be remembered in years tocome. The film promises you to be immersed for the entire duration andcomplete credit goes to the director and the Protagonist.Acting (9/10) - Tom Hanks as Sully puts in so much intensity into thecharacter that one keeps wondering that how does he does it soeffortlessly. Aaron as the first officer Skies is great too and doesfull justice to his part. Laura Linney's part as Sully's wife islimited and she plays the role decently. Overall the movie's greatestasset are its actors.Direction (8/10) - Clint Eastwood's American Sniper remains his bestwork but Sully's direction is one notch below it and its because thestory is pretty simple and the director's role in keeping the storyengaging does not require much effort. Clint Eastwood has of coursedone a commendable job and looking forward to more.Overall, Sully is a great work to keep audience entertained with itssubtle humor at regular intervals. I give it 9/10 as some greatresearch has been done by the cast and crew which has delivered greatperformances too."""
8,"""My take on Sully : First let me say wow what a movie.A real story which showcases power of quick wit of one man and his actof bravery. Feat of a Captain saving 155 lives on board. Also provingHuman brains out wit computer brains or simulations ( watch the movieto understand that one )Another flawless portrayal by Tom Hanks! you were in the water withyour ship as captain Philips now in the air as captain sully either wayyou are nailing it. Salute to you Captain. Clint East wood on each of your projects you are raising the bars andmeeting the expectations. No wonder you are a legendary director.Exceptional and impeccable directorial feat.Verdict : The movie lived well up and above expectations. So what areyou waiting? Grab your tickets and get in for a movie which isIntriguing and gripping. It's a must watch on big screens. Last but notleast I am sure you will return with some moments will put in tears andgoose bumps. - Sivakumar Balachandran"""
8,"""Sully is a very good tribute to all the people who saved the lives of155 passengers of US Airways flight 1549, with special attention on theflight captain's bravery. Clint Eastwood is like a no-frills director,gets straight to the point with his style of film-making which worksespecially on movies based on real life incidents. The effects for the most part are wow, especially the shots of thefinal descent and also the impact on the Hudson. It was a stupendouseffort.The actors are first rate but Tom Hanks stood out with his restrained,natural performance. Aaron Eckhart gives a commendable support toHanks. I was pleasantly surprised to see Anna Gunn(Breaking Bad fame)here. Maybe it's a mannerism, but to me she had the 'I'm gonna burstinto tears anytime' look for most part in the movie. It worked great inBreaking Bad as a wronged wife but it looked a bit odd here for therole of an investigator into the crash. Laura Linney as Hanks's wifewas good although the role was minor and almost weak for an actor ofher caliber.I'd remember this movie especially for the effects and also someemotional moments especially at the end of the inquiry when one or twoinvestigators say what they think personally of what Sully did and alsothe spontaneous reactions of gratitude from passengers or strangerstowards Sully. The movie is a little 'Hollywoodish' in one or twoscenes but never mind. Go for it with your family or friends. It'sstill a clean, feel good cinema that'd leave you with a smile."""
9,"""Tom Hanks is in top form and gives his best performance since Cast Away(2000). After playing a man on the 105th floor of the WTC on Sep 11,2001 in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), he plays a captain ofa doomed double-engine failure plane on January 15th, 2009 in NYC.Writing, editing and emotional directing crafts the portrait of thismodern day modest hero with bravo. The storytelling choices, non-chronological order, details, scenes andpeople portrayed all add the the tension and depth of this fascinating,and familiar to some, story. Laura Linney who is always seen only onthe phone gives a credible (incredible!) performance, while AaronEckhart and his co-pilot character are well utilized.Clint Eastwood ultimately nails it with the right choice of music healso contributes to, like in low-key but grandiose Gran Torino (2008),along with the flashbacks-flashforwards and figments of Sully'simagination to tell the story and inner feelings the best way, and thesheer thrill of a serious and spectacular life and death situation.Everything unfolds perfectly, ends on a high and comical note and feelslike hours because of its intensity instead of the taut 96 minutes inactuality, like the only 24 minutes rescue. Thirteen years after theacclaimed Mystic River (2003), Eastwood and ""Sully"" safely andimprobably land on the river.Like Sully who thanks his co-pilot and crew, the passengers and firstrespondents for this amazing team effort rescue, Eastwood has manypeople on his team to thank, including long time contributor but firsttime real lead editor Blu Murray, for all putting in the piecestogether to this cinematic masterpiece."""
7,"""Having already known the full extent of US Airways flight 1549, bywatching numerous documentaries i.e. Air crash investigation, I wasinterested to see with a bigger budget how the reenactment of theflight would go. The signs were very good going into this film, firstlythe director say what you will about American Sniper, Clint Eastwood isa very talented director. The cast Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are thetwo main draws of the film to entice people to watch it. Now the filmitself, the positives are what I thought they might be, firstly thedirecting. I believe that directing wise this is an improvement fromAmerican Sniper for Clint Eastwood. Some camera positions were veryinteresting and also the perfect blend of CGI of the plane itself withthe backdrop of New York worked really well.The jumps back in timethroughout the film also really worked and didn't feel forced in at anypoint, especially the ""nightmares"" the captain is having, very powerfulimages. Next positive is the acting which is not a surprise to say isvery good, which I think we as an audience have come to expect from Tomhanks these days. He once again knocked it out of the park and gave areally emotional heart to the film as well as the vehicle moving itforward through the story. Aaron Eckhart also was very solid in thisfilm even when his character jokes and the end of the film, very wetimed and shows that he is able to ""compete"" with the very best actorsin the business. All in all this is a good film with solid performancesand directing with an interesting story at the heart of it, well itshould be considering this is a true story. The only negative I canthink of is the middle part of the film starts to drag just little butI am only nitpicking. Finally I would give this film a 7.8 or 7.9 outof 10 not just good enough for an 8 but a damn good film."""

6,"""Clint Eastwood's ""Sully "", a film about Chesley Sullenberger's legaland personal battles after the ""Miracle on the Hudson"", is a film thatsatisfies the audience by utilising strong performances and convertingan intriguing story onto the silver screen. But the film ultimatelyfalls short of great, and it finishes leaving a mediocre taste in theviewer's mouth.One of the strengths in ""Sully"" is its humanistic values and traitsthat are portrayed within the character of Chesley Sullenberger.""Sully"" successfully attempts to paint the picture of Chesley as ahero, who acted in the best interests of humanity, rather than theinterests of money(being the plane). A combination of his heroic moraleand human flaws combine an interesting and deep character, andfurthermore allows the audience to connect to the story. But that's asfar as Eastwood allows the audience to connect. While the performances are strong and the message is dominant, the filmfails largely to take any risks, with either the depiction of thestory, or the story itself. The cinematography, lighting andcomposition is largely dull to look at, besides the few scenes whereSully is having nightmares. The visual aspect of the film lacksheavily, and the whole visual side of the film feels like it's justthere to support the dialogue, which, at moments, feels lazy andcliché. The story at times feels insufficient to be made into a film,which doesn't give true justice to the story itself.The depiction ofChesley Sullenberger, however, give justice to the man, and providesthe backbone to the films quality. ""Sully"" is definitely worth a watch, but having high expectations ofthe film will leave you flat. If you liked any of Eastwood's recentwork, such as ""Invictus"" or ""American Sniper"", then this film shouldappeal to you."""
7,"""For 208 seconds, Sully is saving the lives of all 155 souls aboard UsAirway Flight 1549 when he undertakes an emergency water landing in theHudson River in January of 2009. He emerges a hero at a time when theU.S economy was in the crapper due largely to the actions of manygreedy short-sighted men making horrible decisions with your money, andheroes were at a premium. The question is: how does this translate to a feature length movie?This can't stretch out two hours. You need drama, you need conflict, sohow is this done?The conflict at the heart of the movie is one that pits humanity versusthe computer. Or human error versus those that second guess. Or thosethat do are criticized by those who don't. For according to computersimulations, done in non-life or death situations, Sully could havemanaged to land the plane on a runway, at an airport, and not have itbecome a total loss in the Hudson River. And it is because of this thatthe authorities investigating the crash (just doing their jobs) try tosully the heroic act of Sully (sorry, bad pun.). We know how it ends, we know where it's going, and for what it's worth,Captain Chesley Sullenberger is without a doubt a hero of the highestdegree. The inspiration that his cool-headedness under enormouspressure provided Americans is incalculable. I just wish the film hadbeen able to communicate that a little better. I wanted there to be aresounding victory, a moment where you could cheer for the good guys.Unfortunately, the closest we came to this was the moment where Sully(played well by Tom Hanks, not my favorite actor but what can you do?)after proving his point about human speed and reaction time, says ""DOyou need any more tests?"" I miss the days when Tom Hanks was not such a serious actor. But thefact that he plays the part without the audience overly thinking aboutthe fact that this is TOM HANKS is a tribute to his talent. Eckhartdoes a great job as his co-pilot and Laura Linney is always great,though it would be better if she had more to do than talk to Sully onthe phone.Overall, in terms of airplane related movies, I'd put ""Sully"" somewherenear ""Flight"" but not as good as ""Flight 93."" Or even ""Airplane!"" Butit's still good."""
1,"""This movie was absolutely amazing. Tom Hanks was great as CaptainSully. He captured Captain Sully's conflict about his decisions reallywell, and it made me sympathise with his character a lot. Of course,all the other characters, including the extras, were great as well. Atfirst I felt sorry for him, but as the story progressed, I admired himmore and more. Sully's ark is great to see, and will make you feel goodin the end.Certain scenes had my heart racing. These scenes aren't filled withexplosions and bullets, rather they consist of a conflict, which leavesthe viewer on the edge of their seat. Scenes where people are sittingare more exciting than the final battle in Suicide Squad. I had goosebumps most of the movie. I can't say that about Suicide Squad.The story was, in one word, amazing. The structure of the story helpeda great deal in sympathizing with Sully, and made me feel really sad,yet proud of him at the same time. The movie makes the viewer feel whatSully is feeling, and that is its best quality in my opinion. The onlydownside to the movie was the somewhat mediocre CGI plane. This,however, changes nothing about the quality of the movie."""

I enjoyedgetting little glimpses into the characters.I got tears in my eyes in a few scenes and was thoroughly engrossed theentire time. I highly recommend this movie.For an hour and a half long movie, the pacing was perfect. A bit ofaction, a bit of talk, some more action, some flashbacks to get a feelfor the character.

There areobviously no mysteries going into this movie. Everybody knows the basicstory. The movie even reveals that very early on. What surprised me ishow emotionally engaging this film was from stem to stern. At one pointmy wife clutches my hand which validated the emotions and tension I wasfeeling at the time. We see a lot of movies (nothing loaded withf-bombs or gore) and this is the best we've seen in a LONG time. Thanksto Eastwood, Hanks and the rest of the pros involved in this endeavor."""
9,"""There aren't many feel-good stories in the world in which we live. It'sa sad fact of modern life that most of the news we hear is bad, andeven events that can be considered triumphs by some have a downside foranother group. In January 2009, America got an honest- to-God miracle,and an authentic hero. No qualifications, no asterisk, nothing but oneof the most amazing stories in aviation history put the right man inthe right cockpit to save 155 lives in a spectacularly-executed waterlanding of a passenger jet on the Hudson River. Over seven years later,the event dubbed ""The Miracle on the Hudson"" is a feature film helmedby director Clint Eastwood with Tom Hanks portraying the man in thepilot's seat for the incredible hair-raising flight: Captain SullySullenberger.US Airways Flight 1549 was supposed to be just another routine run fromNYC's LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, NC and then on to Seattle. Justanother flight in Sully's 42-year career behind the stick of variousaircraft. Less than three minutes into the flight, the plane was hit bya flock of Canadian Geese that completely destroyed both engines andessentially turning the Airbus into a glider. If you're unfamiliar withthe geography of the NYC area, the Hudson River separates NYC from theNewark, NJ area. It's one of the most densely populated areas on earth.Sully was given clearance from both LaGuardia and New Jersey'sTeterboro airport to make an emergency landing, but he determined thatthe only course open to him was to attempt a water landing on theHudson. The wind chill that day was -5 degrees Fahrenheit. The watertemperature in the thirties. Any water landing that put passengers inthe water for an extended period of time would have resulted inextensive casualties. Skillfully landing the plane and joining the crewin evacuating the passengers onto the wings and inflatable emergencyramps (Sully himself was the last person off the plane, only aftermaking two additional sweeps looking for stragglers), Sully was met bylightning fast response from NYC's ferries, NYPD, Coast Guard, and ahost of emergency responders. There were a few injuries, only two ofwhich required overnight hospital stays, but not a soul was lost. The temptation in Sully would be to try to over-glamorize somethingthat was already astonishing as is or make Capt. Sullenberger intosomething more than the quiet, reserved, professional, dignified man heis. The triumph of the film, to me, is that the star of this film isthe crash. Hanks' portrayal of Sully is true to what I've seen of theman in interviews. He's not glamorous or flashy. He's a professionalpilot who took the lives of his passengers very safely. He's humble andsoft-spoken; not the sort of things that make up a Hollywood star. But,I think, that's why everyone identified with Sullenberger and hailedhim: he was one of us. Yes, his job was more high-profile than those ofus sitting in cubicles, but to him, this was him doing his job.Eastwood and Hanks give you pieces of the flight from the verybeginning of the film, but it's not until the finale that you see theentirety of it from the viewpoint of passengers, crew, ground control,and bystanders. Sully is a brief film at 90 minutes; it tells its storytightly, with enough human angles to lend perspective. The narrativedevice used to drive the crash is something I was unaware of, thetremendous pressure exerted on Sully and First Officer Jeff Skiles(Aaron Eckhart) by US Airways and the NTSB, claiming Sully could haveeasily made it back to New York or New Jersey and the water landing hadbeen unnecessary.I viewed the film on the 15th anniversary of 9/11, and that contextneeds to be kept in mind in watching the movie. This occurred just overseven years after the attacks on the World Trade Center, and what couldhave been more devastating than another passenger plane, for whateverreason, hitting a populated area in that same city. Eastwood hasreceived some criticism for shots of planes crashing into buildings asSully replays the events over the Hudson, questioning himself and hisactions, but how could he not be thinking of that worst case scenario?Those were the stakes, you had densely populated metropolitan areas toeach side and the Hudson River. He makes the water landing wrong, atbest, he suffers significant passenger casualties. He gambles on eitherside of the Hudson going for an airport, and he may end up plowinganother passenger jet into the New York skyline. It's difficult to evenimagine stakes that could have been higher.Clint Eastwood, at age 86, has made one of his best films, lending justthe right touch to a story that needed little embellishment. Tom Hanksbrings the same subtle strength and realism to his portrayal of CaptainSullenberger, and Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn, among others, round outa strong ensemble. This is really the first big picture of the fall andit delivers in every way, and I strongly recommend people get out andsee just what a miracle this truly was."""
8,"""Sully is best example of how a great director(Eastwood) can make agreat movie (definitely not his best) with just one line or 208 secstory. Sully is a movie which glorifies the real time effort of a real lifehero who saved every one on the flight and still keeps his humanityintact. The best part of the direction was that director teases you with theaccident which could have happened without showing the real landing onHudson river till last.(he shows 3 different scenario of landingthrough Sully's eyes.) Tom hanks was perfect in every frame( After 15 year, Oscar nominationis on the way) and i couldn't have imagined anyone else for this role.he was pitch perfect and showed how confident captain Chesley 'Sully'Sullenberger was, but at the same time uncertain of his own doing thatif he was the real danger to life of people on the plane. I was immensely impressed by the other hero of the movie, Editing andCinematography. it was great to see how flashbacks and imagination wasused to move story forward. The only disappointment of the movie wasone dimensional role of a talented actress Laura Linney and how she wasgiven only one object to show her emotions and how she was just reducedas a weeping wife. Aaron Eckhart was good and provided some much needed comic relief. On the whole it was a satisfying journey, journey which might be themost important journey of those 155 passengers and crew of their life.I recommend everyone at least give it a try."""
1,"""In Sully you remember why we go to the movies. We go to the movies tobe entertained, We go to the movies to forget our daily lives. We go tothe movies in the hopes we will get to see a good movie. We go to see agood story, good acting, a well developed plot and some action.This is why we need more movies like Sully.Clint Eastwood presents a story that we need, a normal guy , a hero andan simple man that acknowledges everyone who participated in the eventof the downing of an aircraft landing in the Hudson River. Sully starsTom Hanks as ""Sully"" and with a excellent Co pilot portrayed actorAaron Eckhart and a truly gifted supporting cast.At the end of themovie the theater should erupt with applause even though the actorscannot hear our appreciation.Why will Sully make money. It does not lean on top stars to make itwork. It does not lean on a race like in the Ben Hur remake. It doesnot lean on simple action like a Marvel Movie. It does not lean on theLGBT community to buy the tickets up. It does not lean on a whole bunchof fake news stories to drag you in to see it. It does not lean onsocial issues to make you feel like you have to see it. It is notanother sequel or darn remake. It has not been female upped or coloredupped to get you in.Sully tells the story of a hero, and the heroes' that surround them.

1,"""Boring. Very, very dull. Before anyone starts questioning anything,there were advance screenings at the local cinema, that's why I saw itearly. Moving on.Who thought making this story into a film was a good idea? An eventhappened, everyone did their jobs, nothing went wrong. Why all thedrama? Even the film just feels like a news story of the week typething. I didn't know that much about this story so I went in hoping formore insight, but I learnt nothing. I knew going in that the planecrashed into the Hudson and the pilot did a good job. The film offersnothing beyond that.It is competently directed, as expected by Eastwood. I'm a little sickof the colourless visuals, although this wasn't nearly as bland lookingas Jersey Boys nor as murky as the awful J Edgar. Hanks just does hisusual thing pretty much playing himself in the lead role. There isn'tmuch character development in this film, nor any truly memorable orresonant moments. The film lacks insight into the characters, I feel asif I could have had the same experience just reading a newspaperarticle based on this event. It's incredibly dry.I thought Flight with Denzel Washington was a very underwhelming film.And this was a bad version of that. Let that sink in for a little. Atleast there we had the story of him overcoming alcoholism. Eastwoodreally needs to pick films based on more interesting material, as hedid until around 2008. It's pretty surprising to see such lacklustreoutput after films like Gran Torino, Letters From Iwo Jima, andChangeling.You know they're running low on material when they show the crash twicefrom the same perspective. I have no clue what Eastwood was going forthere. Very strange.I'm sorry this review was so short - I just don't have much to sayabout this film."""
6,"""Frankly, I don't understand the script of the movie... He successfullylands a plane with 155 passengers on the Hudson river, and he feelssorry afterwards? And his wife is critical of him (""Couldn't you'vedone anything more dangerous"")? Why? During the whole movie, Tom Hanks has an expression of someone who didsomething bad, or hides something because he's afraid it will berevealed, only for us viewers to find out a the end of the movie thathe did that in order to create the much needed drama this moviedesperately wanted, in order justify itself of being a movie... This ""movie"", however well directed it is, should have been adocumentary in the first place. The events of this plane crash are notenough to create the drama or tensions a movie needs in order to createengagement with the audience. When the movie ends, I found myself a bitconfused, with only one question in my mind: ""That was it?""It's an OK-ish movie, although if it was placed under the ""documentary""title it would be more appropriate."""
8,"""So refreshing to see a movie depicting a hero who isn't a cartoon-likeSuper Hero. The industry is sadly saturated with action-action-actionHollywood films. Sully suffers mildly from post-traumatic stress afterhe successfully lands his damaged plane in the Hudson River, amazinglysaving all 155 of its passengers. After the landing, he is made a heroin the public's eyes, but begins to doubt himself when the aviationpanel believes he could have successfully landed the plane in theLaGuardia runway. This story that unfolds is realistic, intelligent,and moving. Do we really need car chase scenes or explosions to holdour interest? My favorite line of the movie was when the hotel maidhugged Sully, and he asked, ""What just happened?"" The crash was notoverplayed, thus, more tragic. The rescue scene was brutally realistic.The aviation panel's witch hunt was ugly and unfounded, and the factthat this story was based on true event made it even more harrowing.What was needed was for people to stand up and salute at the end of thefinal hearing. Amazing movie."""
7,"""Based on the real events of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"", Sully tellsthe story of the aftermath of a forced water landing on the Hudsonriver. The movie is not particularly exciting, which isn't necessarilya bad thing. The protagonist, Sully Sullenberger, is an unassumingpilot who managed to keep his cool under pressure and save the lives of155 people, but through an investigation, his heroism is put intodoubt. Most of the movie is spent with Sully dealing with his guilt andgoing on runs, besides the significantly more interesting flashbacks.As Sully spends most of this time accomplishing nothing, it ends upbeing quite dry, and I was mostly just waiting to see more about theplane craft and its aftermath. Tom Hanks keeps the movie interestingenough, but the plot is not very strong. I would suggest this movie tosomeone, but personally, I wouldn't buy it on Blu-ray."""
6,"""I think Clint Eastwood is very talented director and Tom Hanks iseasily my favorite actor. He's just good in everything. That beingsaid, I was going to wait to rent this movie because the subject didn'tappeal to me very much. Ended up at the theater with a group of friendswho wanted to see it, so that's what we saw.Put simply, it was just OK.Tom Hanks is always good (in my opinion) and that was still the case.He did really well and might get awards consideration. I don't think hereached the heights of his performances in Philadelphia, Cast Away,Forrest Gump, or Saving Private Ryan or even another bio-pic, CaptainPhillips. He was very good and made the movie watchable. Aaron Eckhartwas also pretty good. My problem with the acting is that I don't feelthose characters would be very difficult to portray, so although theydid a good job, it isn't impressive per se.I am all for creative license, but I think the choice for theantagonists in this film is borderline slander given how actual eventspanned out. That's all I will say about that.The plot honestly doesn't have much going for it. We already know howthe flight ends and thus lose a great deal of dramatic suspense.Eastwood tries to work around this with how he structured the story,but it just felt forced. Three separate times, I believe, we end up ina flashback of the flight in question and it does not add anything tothe story. It quickly grows old.I mean, technically, this film is impeccable. The editing, thecinematography, etc. Clint Eastwood knows how to shoot a movie. So Idon't want to knock it too hard. I just feel like it is prettyforgettable.6 stars is my standard rating for a movie that is well made, but I justdidn't really care about.- I do have to say that Aaron Eckhart's mustache is the star of themovie."""
7,"""This is a film of two parts; the story of Sully and his crew and thestory of the NTSB investigation of the incident.The first part is dealt with well; we get a good picture of the life ofair crew - living in hotels away from home and being involved in themyriad of tasks and issues that the travelling public never get to knowabout. The characterisations are believable and involving.The second part is not dealt with well at all. The film presents agross caricature of the NTSB investigators as being self satisfiedbureaucrats who have already decided what occurred and who is to blame- that is Sully. This is not how it works, in this and most otherinvestigations. The reason for this is obvious - to create a villainous counterpoint tothe heroic flight crew. But the whole thing is so one dimensional. Ialmost laughed when towards the end one of the investigators startsgushing admiration for Sully at a public hearing.There was no need to do this - a more interesting and involving storywould have been to portray the challenges felt by the NTSB team. Aheavy responsibility to get to an account of what happened and why andto make a judgement about cause and contributory factors. Perhapsportray a back story of an investigation which went wrong withsignificant consequences.But hey ho - why let facts spoil a good story?"""
1,"""I finally watched this after several weeks of it playing with my movietheatre-working friend yesterday. He had watched this before but waswilling to watch with me as I hadn't. It was quite a touching truestory of Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, played here by TomHanks. The drama took its time in telling how the plane ended up whereit ended up and why he was being investigated despite being called ahero because none of the passengers suffered badly during the crisis.Clint Eastwood did a good directing job, as usual. Going back and forthduring some sequences, I managed to not be confused at all whilewatching which is a good sign of a fine drama based on something thatactually happened. So on that note, I highly recommend Sully."""
4,"""Clint Eastwood, his political views aside, might be wise to stick withcomedy, like Space Cowboys (since he's too old to play Dirty Harryanymore), and leave the directing to better people. Are there any leftin Hollywood? I realize that this movie was not meant to be a documentary, which is agenre that I often enjoy, and I also realize that Hollywood has to dowhat is best for their revenue, which often means sensationalizing""true stories"", (Like the movie Race the Sun, about a good friend ofmine, but almost totally fictitious) but we're talking about theMiracle on the Hudson here, it's sensational as it is. Granted, theintensity only lasted for 208 seconds (plus another minute or two toget out of the plane), but there is sooo much of the story that thismovie could have told, but didn't, like the rescue, background of thoseinvolved, etc.All the confusing bouncing back and forth in the timeline, all of thedistortion of the events, were beneath Tom Hanks acting abilities. Andthe portrayal of the NTSB was pure fiction. So much so, that they spokeout as soon as they heard about the movie. Search: bloomberg crashinvestigators pan their portrayalI still give the movie 4 stars, because Tom Hanks played his roll well(and the other actors tried, especially Aaron Eckhart), although Tom'sheart didn't seem to be in this one. And if you don't care aboutaccuracy, it was an OK movie. It's worth seeing once, I guess, with agrain of salt (or a mine), but unlike many movies in the same ""TrueStory"" genre, I doubt I'll watch this one more than once."""
8,"""From actor/director Clint Eastwood, 'Sully' tells the story of theaftermath, through the eyes of Cpt. Chelsey Sullenberger (Tom Hanks),about that fateful day in which he miraculously landed a passengeraircraft on the Hudson river.1. There is no film that I can think of, in which Tom Hanks ever gave abad performance. Nor have I ever disliked a character Tom Hanks hasplayed. The man is a National Treasure, and one of the greatest livingactors of out generation. Even if one has never seen an interview withthe actual Cpt. Sullenberger or simply can't remember, Hanks completelyloses himself in the role of Sully. There is a blatant reason why Hanksis a two-time Oscar winner, and could very well be heading towardsanother nomination here cause he absolutely deserves it and all thepraise he's getting.2. Apart from the master himself, I was just as equally impressed withthe acting of Aaron Eckhart, who plays Sully's co-pilot Jeff Skiles.There is never a moment where you doubt the chemistry between these twobecause their acting is on another level. Mr. Clint Eastwood himselfdeserves an incredible amount of praise just by his directing alone. Ifthis man doesn't get a nomination for 'Best Director', I'll literallypull a 'Dirty Harry' on the Academy. The film is short, but it's editedin such a superb way that it never leaves you feeling bored.3. There are just a few hiccups here and there that just doesn't makethis film quite as perfect. Laura Linney plays Sully's distraught wifeLorraine, however she never comes across as such since all her scenestake place within the confines of her home. Maybe the reason is due tosome scenes being cut, but her range is never fully explored. Withevents that could have ended in tragedy, there are (unfortunately)nightmares that follow. There are dream and elapsed sequences whereSully envisions the worst, from the plane crashing, to passengerslosing their lives.All in all, 'Sully' is still a sharp and well directed cinematicfeature, and something those who witnessed the miracle themselves,should be proud of."""
1,"""I have always liked Tom Hanks, especially in Castaway! The specialeffects of the plane crash and reenactment of the rescue looks almostidentical to what we saw on the news. I have been wanting a reallygood, REAL movie lately, and this was it! Great acting with a greatstory. Clint Eastwood is an awesome director too!We all watched this story unfold on TV and most of us were amazed atthe obvious skill of the pilot. I mean how do you coast an airlinerinto the Hudson, without tearing the plane apart and without losing asingle person? You really feel the tension and stress in those shortfew seconds when the engines are out, and the plane is losing altitudequickly. The movie does a great job of making you feel like you arethere in the cockpit with ""Sully"" as he makes these life and deathdecisions in seconds, while remaining calm."""
6,"""As far as films about air disasters go, ""Sully"" is a difficult one topull off. The flight itself lasted only five minutesso how doesdirector Clint Eastwood manage to keep our interest for the 96 minutelength of the film? The introduction is certainly grippingEastwoodimagines what would happen if Sully decided not to ditch the plane inthe Hudson. The imaginary sequence of events depicts a disastrous crashinto skyscrapers reminiscent of what happened on 9/11. Instead of taking us to the airport right before the miraculous flight,Eastwood flash forwards to the beginning of the National TransportationSafety Board (NTSB) investigation where Sully's decision to ditch theplane is questioned by Board investigators. The first part of theinvestigation and its conclusion are book-ended into Acts One and Threeof the film's narrative. Act Two is a recapitulation of the flightitself and the subsequent attendant rescue efforts.The actual crash is quite gripping, chronicling exactly how the planewent down after a huge flock of geese took out both the plane'sengines. Tom Hanks as the expert pilot doesn't quite exude the gravitasof the real Captain Sully but once the geese hit, the A-list actormanages to more than ably convey the machinations of a genius of theskies on autopilot.For those who want more of the crash from different angles, the fiveminute anomaly is recapitulated in the third act through a series offlight simulations served up during the NSTB investigation. At first,it's posited that Sully had enough time to return to either LaGuardiaor Teterboro airports. But once the human factor is added in, theadditional seconds added into the simulation prove that the flightwould have been doomed.Sully only fails in its rather unconvincing attempt to create villainsout of the NTSB investigators. In real-life, the investigation took 15months; here it's condensed to a very short time. While theinvestigators were just ""doing their job,"" here their aggressiveprobing suggests that they were out to ""get"" the intrepid Sully. TheNSTB's statement regarding the film speaks volumes about Eastwood'sattempt to make them the bad guys: ""we were not afforded an opportunityto ensure our actions and words were portrayed with accurate context orreflected our perspective.""Sully probably should be probably nominated and declared winner of the""feel good"" film of the year. In another sense, it can be viewed as theperfect ""anti-9/11"" film, as it depicts a happy ending involving an aircrash. Eastwood has done a good job crafting a narrative with limitedpotential for drama. Casting the NTSB investigators as the bogeymanhere was somewhat of a cheap shot, but necessary to ensure that thefilm had some kind of antagonist."""
7,"""Given where I live I have a vague memory about the Miracle on theHudson. That is to say I remember it happening and being on all of thenews channels, but I never really cared to follow up on the events pastthose first few days after it happened. What the movie Sully brings isat best an exhilarating account of bravery displayed by Capitan Sullyand at worst a little bit of feel good drama where the drama feelsinflated.Lets start off with Tom Hanks as the titular Captain Sully. Hanks isnot only the perfect choice for this role, he is the only choice forthis role. No actor working today brings as much trust and inherentcompassion better than Hanks can. From the first moment that the NTSBstarts questioning him about the events during the emergency waterlanding I immediately believe Sully. I trust that he did the rightthing and that is because of Tom Hanks. He has made a career of beingthe good guy and this role demands that he be the best good guy he hasever been, and he nails it. Aaron Eckhart is solid in his supportingrole because he is able to play off of Sully's personality. He allowsthe viewer to step into his shoes and play co pilot in our heads. Inthose 208 seconds he has to trust Sully like we trust Hanks and youfeel that in his performance.Even though I was not really sold on the CGI in Sully, the ""waterlanding"" scenes were the highlight of the movie. Even though theyshowed the same sequence of events more than a couple of times, eachtime it felt different. Eastwood lets you view it through the differentlenses of the people involved, the passengers, the crew and even thepeople on the ground viewing it from office buildings and homes. Whilethe CGI sometimes broke my immersion when they put you in the plane iswhen it really shines. I could almost feel the bottom of my seat dropout as if the theater had lost both engines.Most of the issues I have with Sully are nit picking. The direction byClint Eastwood is unimaginative, the writing is average but the biggestproblem is one that Eastwood suffered from in his last movie AmericanSniper and that is an unrealistic villain. This time around Eastwooddecided that the real opposition to our hero is over zealous governmentofficials and white people problems. For me the real problem for Sullyshould have been the constant terror of what if. What if he had donesomething differently that day or what if he had put those people indanger? They allude to this a bit but I think this really should havebeen the emotional focus. At least thats what gave me the willies themost. Although i did say the writing was average, Sully actually aswhat most movies miss and that is an earned third act. The writerssaved all their really good stuff for that second to third acttransition. They even have a few twists for you at the end there whichI did not expect at all.Sully can sometimes be dragged down by the low points and dialogueheavy scenes but when it has to the movie really turns it on. at anhour and 37 minutes the length is just about right, there were a fewscenes that kind of felt added in to pad the run time but it was adecently paced movie with as I said before a great third act. I did notexpect much from Sully but I am here to say I have been proved wrong.This is a story about a true American hero, but more than that Sully isjust a flat out amazing person who deserves for people to really knowhow great he is."""
8,"""The sight of a passenger plane along the skyline of New York city is animage that has been seared in the global collective consciousness. It'sa memory that ""Sully,"" Clint Eastwood's new film, acknowledges, butalso attempts to redefine. What if a plane skimming skyscrapers couldconjure an image not just of unimaginable terror, but one of incredibleheroism and skill? That's what ""Sully"" might accomplish, in committingto film the heartwarming story of ""The Miracle on the Hudson,"" whenCaptain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger made a forced water landing on theHudson River with 155 passengers aboard a U.S. Airways flight toCharlotte. Erez Harosh"""
7,"""In ""Sully,"" Captain Chesley Sullenberger spends a fair amount of timemusing about how his life's legacy is defined by a plane crash thattook only 208 seconds. Sully's life was only noteworthy for those 208seconds. As one might predict, it turns out that this biopic is alsoexciting for about 208 seconds.Sully's main focus is on Capt. Sullenburger's difficulty handling themedia attention following the crash, and the investigation that theairline did into Sullenburger post-crash. If you don't remember hearingmuch about this investigation in the news, that's because it wasn'tnewsworthy. The movie makes this investigation to appear bigger than itis, and the threat of a lawsuit lasts for exactly 90 minutes of screentime, only to magically disappear as the movie is about to end. Justbefore the credits roll, even the villainous plaintiff lawyers seem toconcede that they never really had a case against Sully anyway. Thisthreat never seemed credible to the viewer, and it disappears in anincredibly anti-climatic way.While great biopics like Fincher's ""The Social Network"" play up realdramas in the lives of notable historical figures, ""Sully"" is a 90minute picture about a three minute event. Luckily, Eastwood handlesthe crash itself pretty well, showing the viewer windows into the livesof multiple passengers on the plane, so we have people to be concernedfor in the heat of the action.The movie suffers from jarring edits and needless jumping in thenarrative. Sometimes we see Sully before the crash, and sometimes wesee him after- the crash itself is shown about halfway through thefilm. Before we see the crash, there are a handful of ""gotcha!"" momentsin which we see the plane almost crash inside of Sully's daydreams. Thewhole concept of jumping back and forth seems totally random andunnecessary. The ""gotcha!"" daydreams also only hurt the film, as theycause nothing but frustration for the viewer.This is a weak film by Eastwood's standards. Even though its runtime isa slim 1h 36m, Sully feels overlong, and that's because there's simplynot much to make of the story. This is a competent enough movie, and isa better choice than some other films currently in theaters, but youshouldn't lose too much sleep if you skip this one."""
9,"""Clint Eastwood's latest offering ""SULLY"" has been doing slam-bangbox-office business in the USA since it is a well done Near Disasterfilm, and in a dark year of police shootings, other shootings, traincrashes, and an upcoming election featuring candidates both of whom arelikely to bring the entire nation to the brink of disaster, provides aray of hope and something to feel good about --namely, the saving of155 passenger lives when a quick thinking American pilot ditched hisplane in the Hudson River after both his engines failed upon takeoffdue to the unintentional ingestion of a flock of birds.This is not one of Mr. Eastwood's masterpieces but it is a very wellmade film (as usual with Clint) with near documentary effect and,obviously, very user friendly. What Eastwood has set out to do --andvery effectively accomplished -- is to remind a public with impairedshort term memory of an act of American heroism that took place a mereseven years ago and received massive news coverage at the time, but wassoon lost in the shuffle of News overload with which we are bombardedevery day -- and basically forgotten. How many people, even if theyvaguely remember the event, can recall the name of the pilot who almostmiraculously saved the lives of all of the 155 passengers aboard hisplane when the plane was disabled upon takeoff from Laguardia in NewYork, by steering it powerless straight over Manhattan, managing not tocrash into one of the towering skyscrapers, and safely ditching theaircraft in the icy waters of the wintry Hudson? The date was January15, 2009, and the quick thinking pilot was Chesley Sullenberger -- notan easy name to remember -- but his nickname ""Sully"" is one that stayswith you. So Clint has wisely chosen to name his picture just that andcast the best man in Hollywood for the job of playing Scully, TomHanks. Hanks sporting snow white hair in the picture is the right age-- 59 during the shoot whereas Sully was 56 in 2009 -- and nobody isbetter at playing men with a troubled conscience and constant painedexpression. Following in the heels of last year's ""Bridge of Spies"" Tomhas just about cornered the Pained Expression for a Whole Picturemarket. And he is actually believable doing it even if sometimes getsto be a bit much.Among other things Sully is a detailed process film about the pilotingof airliners, but it is also much more. Most of the film actually takesplace outside of the cockpit revealing Sully's struggle to justify hiscourageous act before a relentless board of inquiry trying to provethat he had other choices, such as landing at Teterboro Airport in NewJersey. Even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the mediafor his unprecedented feat of aviation skill the investigation that wasunfolding, and takes up the bulk of the picture's running time, wasthreatening to destroy his reputation and his career which adds adimension of courtroom drama to the whole. In the end we find out hemade the only decision possible after the plane was disabled shortlyafter takeoff when a flock of birds were swept into both enginesknocking them out of commission. These scenes are white knucklers thatput you right into the cockpit with Hanks and the co-pilot, AaronEckhart -- in a highly commendable supporting role. Another importantrole is that of his wife (Laura Linney) who is often on the phone withhim with words of anxious support as he walks the streets of Manhattanhaving nightmares in broad daylight of the plane under his control notmaking it to the river but crashing into a building in a blaze ofinglory. The scene in the river with a real plane floating precariouslyin the icy waters half submerged and the passengers lined up on thewings waiting for rescue teams to arrive must have cost a fortune tomake and is so well mounted it looks like archival footage. Fall intothe water and you're dead in a minute! -- even though we think we knowthe final outcome it's suspense all the way. Clint really knows hisbusiness and his new film is definitely a winner with various Oscarpossibilities down the line, maybe even a third Oscar for Mr. Hanks. Atage 86 Clint Eastwood, director, Is not looking back and shows no signsof slowing down. In that department I would consider him to be my rolemodel.Ps: Tom Hanks is a lineal descendant of Nancy Hanks, mother of AbrahamLincoln -- No wonder he has such an incorrigibly honest look!"""
8,"""I've heard this airline captain's story through the news back in 2009during one of my college classes at the time, but had no idea a filmbased on those events was created. Upon watching every minute of it,I'm now able to see what made Captain Sullenberger a hero to hispassengers and those who know him personally.The plot revolves around his heroic efforts as he and his First OfficerJeffrey Skiles navigated their US Airways plane right into the HudsonRiver as a last ditch of effort after their plane had collided withCanadian Geese that flew right into the plane's engines. Despite suchactions that saved their lives, there was also debate on thecircumstance on what could've happened or what would've been betterthan Sully himself had explained.Tom Hanks' portrayal of the renowned captain was a pretty impressiveperformance. Instead of just merely trying to emulate the real-lifeairline captain's experiences on screen, he managed to capture theangst and personal struggles Sully had faced following from thattraumatic event. The board hearing scenes had so much to talk aboutthat it left me further curious on what made these events run intomotion. For example, when using flight simulators as to project whathappened that day and combining it with Sully's recollections via PTSDvisions, it's like placing ourselves into his shoes step-by-step.Director Clint Eastwood followed up well from his previousOscar-nominated film American Sniper by cranking out a story thatfocuses on how one man who doesn't see himself as a glorified hero, buta man who did anything a professional pilot would do by taking suchincredible risks to save the lives of himself and those aboard. For abiographical drama that touches on the mystery and intrigue, this is amust-watch and is sure to hit various accolades."""
8,"""Real heroism does not always mean glory and parades. Sometimes itconsists of simply doing what works  getting the job done in a waythat those affected will always be grateful. Such a hero is ChesleySullenberger, a US Airways pilot whose presence of mind, competence andgood judgment saved the lives of 155 passengers and crew when he landedhis stricken plane in New York's Hudson River in 2009, an episode knownas the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" This miracle is celebrated in86-year-old director Clint Eastwood's Sully, based on Sullenberger'smemoir Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters. Written by ToddKomarnicki, the film stars Tom Hanks (""A Hologram for the King"") as thecalm, unflappable Sully and Aaron Eckhart (""Courage"") as his supportiveco-pilot Jeff Skiles.Eastwood and cinematographer Tom Stern establish the tension early. Wesee the Captain and co-pilot go through their pre-takeoff checklist andwitness the takeoff and the passengers on US Airways Flight 1549, enroute from LaGuardia Airport in New York to Charlotte, North Carolina,settling back for a long flight. Six minutes after takeoff, however,the plane is hit by a flock of geese, crippling both of its engines atan altitude of only 2,800 feet. While we know the eventual outcome,Sully's agonizing decision to land the plane in the frigid Hudson Riverafter realizing he could not make it to the nearest airport is aheart-pounding sequence.While Eastwood succumbs to some disaster clichés with frightenedparents holding onto their screaming children, the evacuation, for themost part, is done with restraint and the rescue by boas and ferries inthe vicinity is expertly handled. The crash sequence (shown severaltimes during the film) is interspersed with flashbacks to Sully's earlylife, his present-day nightmares, and phone calls to his anxiety-riddenwife Lorraine (Laura Linney, ""Mr. Holmes""). Much of the film's dramacenters around the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hearingin which board members played by Mike O'Malley (""Concussion""), JameySheridan (""Spotlight""), and Anna Gunn (""Equity"") question Sully'sdecision to land in the river, suggesting that the second engine wasstill functional enough for him to bring the plane back to LaGuardia orfly to nearby Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. If their assessment isthe correct one, it would lead to a damaging verdict of ""pilot error.""The NTSB uses computer simulations to try to prove their case but Sullytells them that, ""Simulations take all humanity out of the cockpit."" Onquestioning, Sully learns that the ""sim"" pilots needed as many asseventeen practice sessions and he asks that 35 seconds be entered intothe calculations to reflect the human equation. It is no secret thatthe real NTSB has disputed the prosecutorial manner in which thehearings are portrayed, saying that they were only seeking informationin an objective, professional manner, a description that incidentallySully Has agreed with. Tom Hanks is the perfect choice to play Sully.Though beleaguered with stress, self-doubt, and media hounds, hishumanity and strength of character come through, allowing the film todeliver a believable message of human resourcefulness in the face ofsudden crisis.Though Sully is portrayed as a conventional, solid-citizen type, inreality he had the courage to step up at the House Transportation andInfrastructure Committee's subcommittee on aviation on February 24,2009, telling them that, after flying almost 20,000 hours for 29 years,his decision to remain as a professional airline pilot came at asignificant financial cost. His pay, he said, ""has been cut 40 percent,my pension, like most airline pensions, has been terminated andreplaced by a PBGC guarantee worth only pennies on the dollar."" ""I amworried,"" he went on, ""that the airline piloting profession will not beable to continue to attract that best and the brightest.  If we do notsufficiently value the airline piloting profession and future pilotsare less experienced and less skilled, it logically follows that wewill see negative consequences to the flying publicand to ourcountry."" Telling the truth is another attribute of a true hero."""

But Clint Eastwood knew how to absorb the audience intoSully's life during and after the crash. Tom Hanks was a perfect fit to play Chelsey Sullenberger with his calmdemeanor and passion.

These two made an absoluteteam as they underwent constant criticizing from the media and NTSB.This movie will have you pushing for Sully and backing him on him doingthe right thing while others looked for flaws on how to make it hisfault even though he saved 155 people.

9,"""One of the picture's most valuable contributions to the saga of the'Miracle on the Hudson' is that the event was not a plane crash, but asuccessful forced water landing. Captain Chesley Sullenburger (TomHanks) appropriately called for that distinction more than once duringhis insightful soul searching and more significantly, in front of theNTSB review board. That's where the real drama took place, separate andapart from the tense moments on board the ill fated United AirwaysFlight 1549.Anyone who recalls watching the drama of the real life event back in2009 will certainly describe Captain Sully a hero, even if he wasrather self consciously proclaiming that he was just doing his job.What virtually no one is aware of was the intense pressure he and hisco-pilot Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were subjected to, in order to convincethe review board that dealing with human lives in a life or deathsituation can't conceivably be relived using computer simulations.That's one of the main gripes I've always had when it comes tocorporate 'logic' and defending principles before a committee thatnever walked the walk but expect others to be in lock step withexpected behavior based on a computer model.As always, Tom Hanks performs at a professional best level as CaptainSully, effectively portraying the real captain's physical presence anddemeanor. It was gratifying to see that director Eastwood paid tributeto the real life hero by including a clip at the end of the picturewith some of the passengers who successfully came through the ordeal.One note of caution to prospective viewers regarding Sully'snightmarish visions while reliving the tragedy in his own mind - thescenes are poignantly similar to footage resembling the events of 9/11and have the same kind of harrowing impact."""
6,"""Eastwood's directorial efforts are undeniably skillful dramas full ofhuman resilience. Sully is no different, and may be his best in years.For some, that may be great news; for me, that's not saying much.Completely lacking in dramatic subtlety, Sully still somehow feelsoddly distant and cold. On the other hand, itsnon-scifi-action-superhero-franchise thrills and intrigue aredefinitely a welcome reprieve after a long summer. Like an airline bagof peanuts, Sully's far from a delicious meal, yet it certainly helpspass the time. It's the harrowing true-story of acommercial-pilot-turned-national-hero successfully landing a plane onthe Hudson River, saving everyone on board and potentially hundreds ofNYC citizens. It's a stoic movie about a stoic man who is thrust intoexcitement. Playing the titular ""Stoic""uh, I mean ""Sully""is Hanks,who has taken a step-down in intensity, complexity and effectivenessfrom his other real-life-hero-on-the-water role in Captain Phillips.Instead of studying the psychology of an every-man experiencing suddenstardom through immense trauma, it hits fairly predictable biopic beatswith on-the-nose and corny dialogue and performances. Luckily, thecenterpiece plane crash and subsequent rescue is pretty fantastic. Thegreat mixture of high thrills and drama told with grounded realismgives it a surprisingly honest and non-glorified portrayal. It's noaccident this was released on 9/11, as that horrendous day played suchan integral part in what made Sully such a beloved figure. People in NYbuildings watching a plane fly low through their city, followed by thefamiliar humanity in the rescue boats, it's hard not to be moved. Thosebeautiful moments propel an otherwise bland movie that yourgrandparents will surely love."""
8,"""Suly opens with Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) havinga PTSD-induced, 9/11- reminiscent vision of a plane crashing into aManhattan skyscraper. This is the ""what-if"" scenario that haunts thetitular hero after successfully landing the engine-blown Flight 1549 onthe chilly Hudson River, and miraculously saving all 155 souls onboard.As he snaps back into reality, we will soon learn that the ""untoldstory"" lies on the aftermath of the averted tragedy. The NationalTransportation Safety Board (NTSB) starts to investigate and findsresults that does not jibe with Sully's estimation: the left engine isstill operational and he could have landed the plane on the nearestairport instead of risking passengers' lives with a forcedwater-landing. ""Over 40 years in the air, but in the end I'm going tobe judged on 208 seconds,"" Sully laments and sadly, he's right. Hasthere been a lapse of judgment on his part? Or could this be NTSB'sattempt to use him as a scapegoat against the future lawsuits that willbe filed? Director Clint Eastwood may put you into the mind of Sully,yet you won't be able to conclude beyond a shadow of a doubt.Eastwood turns this feature film into an introspective character studynarrated in a contemporary fashion. He feeds his viewers withseamlessly-integrated, piecemeal flashbacks that takes us to the eventson that fateful afternoon. He does not take the route of presenting astraightforward inspirational tale but he's more interested on a biggerissue here  man's internal turmoil to redeem himself. As we witnessedin his previous works like American Sniper, this is where he shinesbest. Still, he remains simple as a filmmaker. The restrained executionof plane crash may not please fans of extravagant tent-pole films butthe wave impact brought by the musical scoring and sound editing isimpressively realistic and accurate.Hanks shines as well in this yet again perfectly-tailored role  abrave, diligent and sturdy ordinary American hero facing againstinsurmountable odds. It's already a cliché thing to say that Tom Hanksis a brilliant actor but what I like about his performance is that itdoes not scream of: ""Look at me! I'm a great actor! Give me an Oscar!""He can be minimal in his acting  during an intense bird-enginecollision scene, he stoically yells ""Birds."" and still, he sells anuanced depth into the character. The same can be said to theunderrated Aaron Eckhart as co-pilot Jeff Skiles, the funny guy whomocks the things that Sully is often too nice to say. He earns thefilm's final laugh.Whereas Hanks has weathered rougher storms in his previoustravel-disaster films like Apollo 13, Cast Away and Captain Phillips,Sully, however, offers less dramatic weight. We already know by nowthat everything will turn out fine in the flashbacks so the suspensegets to be partially ruled out. It can also be a bit underwhelming thatthe closest thing you'll have here for antagonists are the suspiciousbureaucrats (Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, and Jamey Sheridan) armed withcomputer simulations that should put Sully's career and pension atrisk. The depiction of investigation somehow appears to be exaggeratedfor the sake of adding tension. The straw villains here will probablyhave more social relevance when they are viewed as Eastwood's take onmodern cynicism: that even the noblest of men can still be subjected toharsh scrutiny.Just when Sully is on the verge of becoming a saccharine adulation toits hero, Sully gives credit where credit is due, ""I don't feel like ahero. I'm just a man doing his job."" He's right. This is not only thestory of a man saving 155 souls but this is the story of a wholecommunity coming together in the midst of tragedy  his co-pilot, thepassengers, the flight attendants, the radio operator, the ferry boatcaptain, the coast guards and even the bit- players, no matter howthinly-sketched as they may be. Eastwood may not succeed in offeringmuch meat for those who are expecting of a shocking conspiracy, but thefact that he's been able to effectively deliver the human element froma 208-second incident in such a short run- time is praise-worthyenough.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/sully"""

Sullenberger'sactions came under tight scrutiny because the airline ""lost a plane.""As it turns out, the lead investigator for the NTSB wasn't played quiteaccurately.

Both of these men haveproved to play defining roles in modern American cinema, with Hanks'ever-present acting capabilities and Eastwood's interesting andinnovative directing skills after having somewhat of a remarkableacting career himself. That being said, I had my doubts about 'Sully'.Movies based on real events hardly ever satisfy me, whether on anentertainment standpoint or the fact that they aren't often true to theactual story. So is this movie accurate to real life events? Maybe. I'msure a few creative liberties were taken because we are watching a filmmade by Hollywood, however, if this film does in fact exaggerateanything, than it still does not fail to pay tribute to a clearlyunderrated American hero and all 155 people he saved on January 15th,2009. Hanks is of course fantastic. His skills as a dramatic actor faroutweigh his comedy's (though those aren't without their good points),so I had no doubts that at the very least I was going to see awell-acted film. Aaron Eckhart does not command the screen nearly asmuch as Hanks, but I think he wouldn't seem so insignificant if hewasn't sharing the screen with someone who has star power like Tom. Andas far as Eastwood's directing goesI absolutely loved the camera-workin this movie, and it was definitely the best thing about the wholefilm for me. Every shot creates a nice effect in which something iscentered, whether it be a person, object, or a simple spot on the wall.Then, there will be something to watch on the right and left sides ofthe screen to the effect that I would have to turn my head to the leftin order to see Tom Hanks, then turn to the right in order to seewhoever he was talking to. Perhaps this explanation makes it all sounda bit simplified and ordinary, but nevertheless I was captivated (thecamera-work definitely helps to overshadow the few poor moments of CGIthat occur. From a sequence in which Hanks and Eckhart are digitallyplaced into an old David Letterman episode to the actual crash of theplane, it's easy to tell what is fake no matter how good the scenesplay out). But they do play out well. Very little of a musical scorecan be found here, which I am every bit alright with. A certain quietintensity is added to the crash sequence because of this. This is, bythe way, a sequence which you will have to see several times overbefore the credits roll. It is often presented from differentviewpoints or in different clips and this makes it a little moretolerable, but it is worthy of mentioning solely because facts likethis is what can make a movie completely un- re-watchable in the end.However, I do think I'll be able to see 'Sully' a few times more if notfor the simple fact that it is one of the most well-made movies on atechnical level that I have seen in a long time. And it is so well-madethat it is entertaining in areas that most movies might not be. 'Sully'is one of the top 3 films of the year so far for me, congratulationsand a hearty ""well done"" to both Eastwood and Hanks! 8.5/10"""
9,"""I would like to cast my vote for best picture, best director and bestactor. Sully. While it includes the details of the actual event ingreat detail the story mainly focuses on what transpired after theincredible water landing on the Hudson. This is a little known part ofthe story that was not reported on by the mass media. It reveals thepost event ordeals that Sully and his co-pilot were put through. TomHanks portrayal of Sully is nothing short of amazing. One of his bestperformances that I've seen in years. I also happen to think that hisoverlooked performance in ""Bridge of Spy's"" was nothing short of atravesty. The direction of Sully is suburb. Clint Eastwood blends theactual events, flashbacks into Sully's earlier days and the aftermathinto a seamless heroic tale. I highly recommend this movie. The worldis short on hero's these days. Sully is one heroic story."""
7,"""I saw ""Sully"", starring Tom Hanks-Bridge of Spies, Turner & Hooch;Aaron Eckhart-London Has Fallen, The Rum Diary; Laura Linney-TeenageMutant Ninja Turtles:Out of the Shadows, The Truman Show and MikeO'Malley- Concussion, Glee_tv.This movie tells the incredible true story of how Chesley Sullenberger,a pilot that landed a plane that had lost both engines after hitting aflock of geese about 30 seconds after takeoff, on the Hudson river inNew York on January 15, 2009, without any casualties-all 155 people onboard survived! Now you may be familiar with the story but this movieis based on the book 'Highest Duty', written by Sullenberger and tellsthe behind the scenes story, you may not know. It's directed by ClintEastwood-I think this is something like his 35th movie to direct. Tomplays Sully-Sullenberger's nickname-the man who became a hero to NewYork and most of the country after his heroic landing. Laura plays hiswife and Aaron plays the co-pilot. The National Transportation SafetyBoard launched an investigation almost immediately-the chairman isplayed by Mike. They were concerned with any human error that may havecaused the forced water landing; had Tom or Aaron been drinking? Drugs?Family problems? They ran computer simulations trying to see if theplane could have made a safe landing or not. Tom & Aaron were justdoing their jobs-not to mention that they saved everyone on board-andnow they were having to worry about their reputations and thepossibility of even losing their careers. It is an interesting story.It's rated ""PG-13"" for peril and language and has a running time of 1hour & 36 minutes. I really enjoyed it-it's hard for Tom Hanks to makea bad movie-but it's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing wasfine. It would make a great rental, though."""
8,"""Absolutely love Clint Eastwood movies, both the ones in which he acted,as well as directed, to a great extent. Based on what little I've seen of his mammoth body of work, both infront of and behind the camera, I divide his body of work into 4phases: Post Rawhide, post his Sergio Leone spaghetti western trilogy,post Dirty Harry, post 'Play misty for me', post 'Unforgiven' and posthis conversation with the chair (yes, that happened). I've been (called) an Eastwood apologist too, when it came to defendinghis work in/on movies like 'Dirty Harry 5:The dead pool', 'Where Eaglesdare' and 'True Crime', as well as 'J Edgar' and 'Changeling' (throw in'Million Dollar baby' and 'Gran Torino' as well, that some did notfancy). Onto 'Sully' then, the first collaboration between an actor of thecaliber of Tom Hanks, and the consummate thespian Eastwood (who, by theway, scores this once again, pretty decently, I might add - though I domiss his collaborations with Lennie Niehaus). Regardless of the based-on-a-true-story aspect to this, this makes fora companion piece to Robert Zemeckis' fantastic 'Flight'. So, thismovie is not about the event itself, but is about how we perceiveheroes and heroism, and what heroism is all about. Like any othermainstream movie that takes itself too seriously, this also treads safeall the way, while ensuring that the main narrative has quite a bit ofheft. I remember the media covering this the way they do any event nowadays,and the jingoistic tone of most people in awe of both Captain Sully'spresence of mind, as well as the 'miracle' itself. Having followed that when it unfolded, and having watched this movie,I'd speculate that the makers try and stay close to the sourcematerial, framing the narrative in such a way that there are flashbacksthat are contextual in nature. Incorporating aspects like how theicy-cold Hudson river might have had the last word in, if it were notfor prompt first-responders (there are stats that play towards the endthat should give various governments and their politicians some foodfor serious thought to meeting/surpassing the 24-minute barrier - I dohope they don't miss it, with the perceptive blindness that seems morerampant, and even typical, than it was ever before).This has been a good year for biopics and narratives based on truestories, with most makers, even in the mainstream milieu, making agenuine effort to limit their fictional embellishment to a minimum. While that is appreciable, making this tale compelling to an audiencethat did not go thru the ordeal, the way the 155 did, and keeping thefocus trained solely on the Captain and his first mate (a solid AaronEckhart), doesn't quite cut it, imho. This is very unlike the technique followed by Greenglass' most powerfulwork, imho, 'United 93', which quickly put us bang(!) in the middle ofaction, without making the arcs of the protagonists and the antagonistsanecdotal, we felt for each character right until the end.We don't get to know his family, other than perfunctory phone callsbetween the husband and wife. I could not believe that he did not talkto his children. I still am puzzled by that choice. I think there wassomething missing. I could understand that the character was numb andoverwhelmed, but when you've just escaped with your life, don't youwanna talk to the ppl you've brought into this world. Or, if you donot, why is the reason/motivation for that non- communication notshown?Laura Linney, a fine and capable actress, who was well-served byEastwood being at the helm in his underrated 'Absolute Power', iscriminally underused in this one, along with her character having nokind of an arc at all. To me, it does not make sense casting an actressof her caliber if you do not intend to have her perform to herpotential.The contrived way in which one important character gets to understand'timing' and decides to use it, when it might just have been staringhim/her in the face all along, along with touching, perfunctorily, uponhow it was a team effort etc., to me, sounded insincere, if notpatronizing. However, if Eastwood and Komarnicki intended for the sameeffect, I think they quite succeeded there. For all those mis-steps, the movie is filled with powerful andevocative imagery, along with quite a few great performances andset-pieces. Eastwood also inserts his own poster (for 'Gran Torino') ina blink-and-you'll-miss frame. Not sure that was necessary, but notsure if everyone'll catch it either. And I will not be surprised if Hanks is nominated for a Best ActorOscar for this one, though he did better work on another flick of his -Captain Philips (helmed by United 93's Paul Greengrass).As to how I find Eastwood's directorial work on this one? It's not hisbest, unfortunately. I've been waiting waiting to see him surpass hisown work on powerful stuff like 'Unforgiven', 'Million dollar baby' (inspite of all its detractors), 'Mystic river' (for my money, his best,even better than his 'Unforgiven' or 'The outlaw Josey Wales'), 'Aperfect world', 'Letters for Iwo Jima' (I still prefer this to his workon its companion-piece, 'Flags of our fathers' in spite of the factthat both were well-made) and 'Gran Torino'. Still waiting though. Thiswasn't it, and it didn't even come close.Having said all that, this movie definitely needs to be watched,especially by those who do not know much about what actually transpiredon Jan 15, 2009. If what's shown here really went down the way Eastwoodand the writers told us it did, then being human is something trulyamazing."""
8,"""I 'thought' I new the story of what happened so I wasn't eager to goand see the movie. I figured I would wait until later in the year andjust watch it 'On Demand' or some other way at home. But I keptthinking it must be pretty decent with Tom Hanks starring and when Irealized Clint Eastwood directed the movie, that's when I decided I hadto see it in the theater. SO glad I did and if I can make arecommendation, make sure to see this in a theater that offersWidescreen if possible. Most people know about the heroic landing of the plane on the Hudsonriver in New York where all passengers and crew survived. But few ofus, myself included, know all of the details that led up to that eventhappening. Nor was I aware of the questioning by the NationalTransportation Safety Board (NTSB). What is also striking, is despite the heroic move by CaptainSullenberger, he is an incredibly humble man who clearly did not carefor the spotlight nor the fame that came with this. It's interesting ifyou have ever seen the movie ""Flight"" with Denzel Washington wherethere is a horrific crash but the pilot minimizes the crash andeveryone agrees he was the only one who could have done this. Goodmovie except that was fiction and in ""Sully"", this is real life andagain, he is probably the only Captain who could or would have pulledoff this miracle.The only fictitious thing I would say about the movie was the part whenpeople were boarding the plane. Everyone was extraordinarily courteousto each other. People helping others with their belongings in theoverhead bins. Nobody bringing on excess luggage that won't even fit inthe overhead. People being patient as they go down the isle looking fortheir seat and everyone saying thanks, excuse me and please. There wasa woman sitting in a middle seat with an extremely young toddler in herlap. Yeah, don't think that's even allowed, but the man next to her wassmiling and seemed so happy to be sitting next to a woman with a youngchild. The boarding of the plane was a bit fantasy and I heard quite afew people in the audience chuckling at that part. But otherwise, thisis a great movie and here is my 2017 Oscar nomination predictions forthis movie:- Best Picture Nominee - Tom Hanks, Nominated for Best Actor - ClintEastwood, Nominated for Best Director - ""Sully"", nominated for bestcinematography"""
8,"""This movie is engrossing and deserves a high vote.It is based on true events, when a passenger plane needed to make anemergency landing in a city lake. Without doubt the hero of the eventwas the planes captain.Believe it or not there are a lot of people especially world wide whonever heard of the events portrayed in the movie as at the time it wasa sensation all over the planet.At first I was puzzled as to why the movie makers instead of puttingthe attempted plane landing at the center of the picture, concentratedon the awful bureaucrats from the airline safety board who were itseems trying perhaps unfairly to find the captain at fault.However my research suggests that from the perspective of both thecaptain and co-pilot they felt they were being investigated in such away that if they could be blamed for what happened, they would be;hence the movie takes the point of view of the captain and co-pilot.Both the attempted landing and the investigation are certainlycompelling viewing.The lead actor gives a fine yet restrained performance.Even if the decision to land on the lake was not the only alternativethe captain is a Real Hero.All in all, I give this picture 7 and a half, rounded up so:8/10."""
8,"""==THIS REVIEW HERE MIGHT CONTAIN SOME HEAVY SPOILERS. VIEWER DISCRETIONIS THEREFOR ADVICED==If you live in the west you probably already heared of this story.Technically speaking 'some' plane make their way through a flock ofbirds and with both engines hit and unworking, the pilot still managedto make their landing on the river Hudson and all the passenger hadbeen saved. However, hidden to the public eyes there was also aback-story to it. Immidiatelly after the crash there was a federalinvestigation going on, where investigators run simulation programs toget their point proved. The point was that the pilot could get back tothe airport, without putting their passenger on danger by landing onthe river. However as we see through the end of the film, theinvestigators used this programs in the really dirty way, the one thatgets their points prooven in the way that only technically speaking ispossible, but humanly speaking totally impossible. For instance willthe pilot in normal situations really turns around and drive the planeback to the ""base"" the same seconds as the birds hit the engine?, asare things presented in the simulations as they ran Wouldn't he firsttry to run the engines and turned them on, only to realize in shockthat the both engines have stopped working, and he is unable to turnthem on, which is a really rare case I believe. Or wouldn't he make acall to the airport, checking that its free, for not hitting the otherplane, that it's currently rising., and others..The translation of this film in my country is 'Miracle on the riverHudson', which I think is more to the point. As you watch this film youstart to believe that is nothing more then a miracle. Or as Sully(TomHanks) puts it, when he left with his co-pilot the court, it goessomething like that: ""I believe that we get it through very well. Butwe actually put it through better."" Clint Eastwoodis without a doubt a very respectable director and veryrespectable to all the characters involved. However this story alsogets true to the truth as is humanly possible. There is no big bangs,no big unnecessary explosions, as long as they don't put anything tothe Original story. For instance did you notice that when Sully(TomHanks) imagined a building hit by an airplane is the same that thewomen hit during running the second simulations run. You could imaginewhat Could happen if he listened to flight controllers and not, actedon his own, as he did.Technically speaking this is a beautiful crafted film. however I stillhave some negative points. Tom Hanks for instance could be in my eyesmore livable. The film is also crafted with a dark and depressing toneto it, the darkness in this film is more moderated, but in my eyescould be made more livable. All in all, beautifully crafted film, which puts to the real story,answering some answers that might be risen."""
7,"""Clint Eastwood's take on the Disaster film incidentally explains why hehas endorsed Donald Trump for president.The film has the usual air disaster film conventions: the cross-sectionpassenger list, the heroic captain, the beautiful and helpful stewardi,the crash threat, experience and survival. But Eastwood makes fourradical changes. As usual, the meaning lies in how the directorinflects the genre conventions.One, he puts the crash and survival at the beginning. The suspense istherefore not rooted in the passengers' experience when Canada Geesechoke and knock out both engines, necessitating an emergency landing.Instead the suspense lies in the government committee's ensuing enquiryinto whether Captain Chesley Sullenberger made the right decision whenhe opted to land his 155 passengers on the chilly Hudson River insteadof trying to get back to LaGuardia. Two, instead of the usual tensions and even spats that usually erupt ina threatened flight film, this one depicts a harmonious community. Itexplicitly pays homage to New York City, its efficient and effectiveresponse teams, the community spirit not just on the plane but beyond,in the city-wide celebration of Captain Sully and his amazing landing.A bartender gives him the drink, The Sully, he invented: two shots ofGrey Goose and a splash of water. Three, the central focus is not on any passenger but on the captain.The 2009 events are intercut with memories of Sully's earlierexperiences, nightmares of what might have happened on that fatefulflight, and hallucinations of the plane searing through Manhattanbuildings. Instead of showing the passengers' faith being tested hereit's the captain's, as the formal investigation into his conductthreatens his family's security, his 40-year career, and his own faithin his judgment.Four, the film revives the spirit of Eastwood's Dirty Harry in asanitized manner. As Clint's Callahan tossed away the law book tooperate on his own instincts, Tom Hanks's Sully eschews the operationsmanual in the 206 seconds he has to make his decision. He instead""eyeballs"" the problem and follows his instincts. And that's where the film coheres with Eastwood's endorsement of DonaldTrump. The villains here are the government's investigating committeethat goes by the book, that uses fancy high falutin' stuff likecomputer simulations, pilot re-enactments, estimations of lostmachinery, and the la-dee-dah like to cast aspersions on the ""hero"" whosimply followed his ""instincts."" In Eastwood's (and little Donnie's) book, government committees, checksand regulations only interfere in people's lives and keep a Good Manfrom Doing the Right Thing by following his gut. That's why Eastwoodran for mayor of Carmel  to get rid of all the red tape in municipaladmin  and that's why the ostensibly successful multiple bankruptcyblatantly lying Trump gets Eastwood's vote. As Trump ""loves theuneducated people"" Eastwood bets on the man of instinct. It's a very personal story for Clint. Hence his closing song: ""You tellme your story, I'll tell you mine."" It's Sully's but also Clint's."""
1,"""Clint Eastwood is still going strong in his 80's, and Tom Hanks hashigh standards for performing. Having those two legends together isalways a treat, and Hanks' portrayal of the modern hero is among hisbest work. Everyone knows about the captain who saved the lives of hiscrew and the entire passenger load. He achieved the impossible bylanding a plane in the middle of winter on water that could have easilyresulted in drowning or freezing to death. He became and hero, and mostmortals were grateful he had saved many from certain death. There wasstill an element out there who wasn't looking for the positive andtried really hard to discredit Sully.The film is designed in a very interesting way, showing snippets of theday when the landing took place. There are also alternate scenarios;some created by the anxiety in Sully's mind after the event took place.Then, we have simulations ordered by the investigative body to showthat Sully's choice might have not been the wisest. It didn't seem tomatter that he was successful. It feels vindictive and irrational, andthe movement almost succeeds in dragging our hero into a big mess.Hanks' Sully is a quiet and a bit of a surly character. One doesn'tseem to see much of an extrovert there. He does his job, the best hecan, and he displays plenty of heart and integrity, a quality thatcomes in full display when he faces the investigative panel. He's sureto remind them that there is more to the aviation industry than relyingon machines. He reminds us of the stars of the past, and if you thinkit's impossible to show another Hanks' character who shows what itmeans to show the best of humanity.The film is short but packs plenty of emotions. We see the torture andself-doubt, the aftermath and the trauma that Sully undergoes. The slowrevelation of who his character really is. We see his exchanges withhis family, with his colleagues, and with his opponents. We see subtlechanges, but all of them are just facets of a complete person.The technical moments of the film are perfect reproductions of theevent. We see the moments before, during, and the crucial rescuemoments after the landing. We become completely aware of the pain, thefear, and the horror that the impending threat of death feels like.It's Eastwood's at his best, showing a drama, a thriller, and acharacter study, all in one."""
8,"""""Sully"" is not a gargantuan classic; it IS a very well made movie aboutan historical event that brings the reality of the near-tragedy to lifefor the viewer. Tom Hanks does a subtle and masterful job of bringingyou into the pilot's, Sullenberger,character, and Jeff Skiles performsas well in the lesser role of co-pilot. The portrayal of the spouse,Lorraine,was competent, but the script set up a role that lacked thefiber I can recall in the real person. The NTSB protagonist was welldone by Michael Porter, though the script positioned him as avillain--and my knowledge of these people is that they are boring intheir methodical objectivity ( a good thing). My one concern is thatthis movie positions the NTSB in a position to prove a hypothesis,instead of following the facts methodically, as though they weredefending the manufacturer. This seems unfair, and could haveunfortunate societal ramifications"""
6,"""Clint Eastwood is back with yet another true story film. Unlike hislast based on a true story flick, 'American Sniper', 'Sully' actuallyworks pretty well. And it makes for a surprisingly gripping story atthat. If you're unaware, the story is about an airline pilot. The sameone that landed an airbus in the Hudson river in 2009. Naturally, thisis his story. But it's told slightly differently than you'd expect. 60%of the film actually takes place after the incident and the other 40 istold through flashbacks that are triggered in some way. This was theaspect of the film that really suffered the most. There are so manyflashbacks in this movie. There are so many that this otherwise engaging story starts to feeldisjointed. There are one or two that feel genuine and work fairlywell, but the majority are just crammed in where ever they could fitthem. It felt a lot like 'Suicide Squad' in that, these flashbacksdidn't really serve much purpose. They almost felt like they had toomuch footage and decided to just stick it in somewhere.The worst offender happens about twenty minutes in. The film opensafter the water landing, of which we don't see. We see that Sully isbeing put on trial for endangering the lives of his passengers andcrew. This plays out for about twenty minutes and is shockinglygripping I might add, and then it suddenly flashes to directly beforethe flight occurs. But it doesn't just end there. No, we sit for abouttwenty more minutes as we watch the entire accident occur.This scene, and many other flashbacks like it, come out of nowhere andoverstay their welcome. This one, in particular, does nothing for thefilm other than blatantly show you exactly what happened. And thatisn't really a bad thing, but when the first twenty minutes of yourmovie is board meetings, it feels out place to jump to this planescene. We all know the story, and the film does a great job of showingit subtly.Yet, for some reason it stills shows the full event to you. It doesn'thelp push the story forward, nor does it build character. And, to makethings worse, this very scene is shown again later in the film. Withthis second time actually feeling like it belonged there. When you tella story like this through flashbacks, they have to drive thingsforward. A good example of this is 'Incendies'. But 'Sully' just pushes in random footage that rarely helps the film inany way. This effects the pacing drastically. Watching these engagingtrail sequences to only flip to a flashback makes this movie more of alame roller coaster ride. Where you'll be exhilarated sometimes andjust bored the rest of the time. It doesn't help that the shootingstyle is rather bland. The visual style of the film is very mute andstationary. Which can work, but here it just looks boring.By now you are probably thinking that I hated this movie, but I didn't.In fact, I thought it was decent. This mainly has to do with thenon-flashbacks aspects of this movie. When the film plays outuninterrupted it works very well. It's very restrained and subtleactually. The scenes that take place after the crash all felt like theyserved a purpose. Each one helped flesh out our main character orforward the plot with interesting new information that caused conflict.Conflict that actually felt like it had weight to it. Each new piece ofinfo that Sully receives is almost always something bad. And each timeyou can see him sink a little more into himself. And watching this kindof hurts. You know that he's a genuine guy and saved hundreds of lives,but there's always consequences. So when you throw consequences in afilm like this they actually carry weight.You don't want to see him put on trial because he just saved hundredsof people. But that's what happens, and it works very well. Of course,this couldn't have been accomplished without Tom Hanks. Who istypically great. The entire cast is actually pretty great. They alltake on their character in interesting ways even if their charactertranslates to nothing more than a line on a paper.However, 'Sully' is ultimately a frustrating watch. That mainly has todo with the fact that this could have been great and just wasn't.There's an excellent movie in there and it's ruined by jumbledstorytelling. Excessive flashbacks grind the film to a halt nearlyevery time they surface and never really help the film move along. Thisalong with a boring look and bizarrely abrupt scene changes really hurtan overall good movie. The cast, crew and investigation aspects of thefilm are definitely its saving graces. Without them, we'd be left withanother True Story flick to throw by the wayside."""

8,"""True story bio-pics based on real disasters have little room forcreativity because a major aviation incident like landing in the HudsonRiver is so forensically documented. However, the real disaster inSully (2016) is not landing a plane in a freezing river, but thehysteria of the media, airlines, insurance companies and safetyinvestigators, who all voraciously pursued their own vested interestsby undermining the professionalism of a modest pilot who saved thelives of everyone on board.The central incident unfolds only minutes after take-off on 19 January2009 when Captain Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) realises that his AirbusA320-214 has lost both engines on hitting a massive flock of Canadageese. His options were to glide back for an airport landing whilelosing altitude over a densely populated city, or go for anunprecedented water landing onto the Hudson. His decision made historyand he was immediately lauded as a hero until the media's appetite forthe dark side of humanity turned the incident into a witch-hunt. Askingwas he a ""hero or fraud"", the really big doubters were those with mostto gain if human error could be established. While aviation interestsquickly pitted computer simulations against real world decision making,Sully remained focused on cockpit logic. The film spends most of its 93minutes exploring the incident from different perspectives and directorClint Eastwood's masterful storytelling is a perfect mix of facts andhuman insight.It is hard to imagine any actor who could fill this role as well as TomHanks. He captures the understated gravitas of a modest hero whose jobexists at the fleeting intersection between saving and losing lives.The filming style draws you into its vortex while being mercifullylight on CGI effects. We watch over Sully's shoulder at the controlsthen study his face during the critical minutes, before switching topanoptic views from the clouds. The most outstanding feature of thisfilm is the way it frames the narrative and its aftermath, withflashbacks and parallel sub-plots that piece the story together like anelaborate jigsaw puzzle. Disaster films are usually just action dramas,but this one is much more than that. It has the intensity of apsychological thriller as we watch Sully's own confidence beingundermined in the battle between sterile computer algorithms and thekind of intuitive judgement that comes from four decades of flying.This is a thoroughly riveting film."""
1,"""Sully is not a typical bio pic, and sets a new gold standard for how tomake a movie that is thoughtful, touching, and overall about the natureof what it means to be a hero. I actually think this is one ofEastwood's best directed movies, along side Million Dollar Baby andMystic River in the 21st century phase of his career.There are interesting influences that have been seeping in from acouple of Asian directors: Zhang's Hero which approaches this sametopic albeit in a different century and with more extravagant visuals,Ozu for the long, patient camera takes as well as Kurosawa for theRashomon type story that takes place. ""paintent"" is the key word here,as many of the films detractors have said the movie is ""slow"". Noticehow each flashback tells more, and more of the story, much like howRashomon tells the story from different perspectives. Flashback areused as suspense devices, and Eastwood really crafts the picture in waythat even though you think your are watching the same scene (birds!)new information is revealed every time which makes it entertaining. Andentertaining is not a bad word.For a movie touted as a big studio movie about a real life character,and unlike J. Edgar which I would say is about a ""B"" quality moviethough well done biopic, I feel like Sully deserves an the highestrating possible because of the multiple nuances used, and like you saidHanks performance as he disappears into a role unlike any other he hasever had (compared to Captain Phillips, which to me was just Hanksdoing Hanks). Hanks deserves an Oscar nomination at least, and a win atbest. Eastwood makes movies about JUSTICE as a key theme, where 'whatis right is right' and boy does he get his opinions on that across inthis film (which also ties it to previous masterpieces he has done likeUnforgiven, Grand Torino, and High Plains Drifter).When you know how a movie will turn out it is a challenge to make itentertaining and new to the audience, and Eastwood found a way to dothat with several devices and ideas (the court hearings, Sully's jogsand visits to bars around town, his nightmares which echo the 9/11attacks). Seeing this film on 9/11 (which was an accident really) had aprofound effect one as a well. It left me with just enough tears afterit is over. Sully is a movie I would recommend for everyone to see atsome point in their lives, as it is one of the best movies ever made onthe topic of a true life hero, who always includes others in histhoughts and refuses to take credit for his heroic acts (another JimmyStewart-Mr. Smith goes to Washington parallel for Hanks)."""
9,"""I felt it more of a documentary than a movie. But either way, Sully isa MUST WATCH. Arguably, one of the best movies this year. Story -little different than expected; Tom Hanks - top notch and impeccable;Direction - great. Story (9/10): The story is multi-faceted. Contrary to the expectations,Sully is more about the post mortem (post-incident investigation) ofthe Hudson tragedy and the emotions of the pilot, Captain ChesleySullenberger - nicknamed Sully, on whose shoulders, lives of 155people, including him, aboard the US Airways flight hanged in balancefor the fateful 280 seconds. As sub-plots, it also covered stories ofsome of the passengers and the people involved in the rescue. The themeof the movie was very different from what I thought and that's what Iloved about it. It narrated the perspective of the pilot on why he didwhat he did (landing into Hudson river) and his thoughts for thosecouple of minutes. The story also delves into Sully's life - his teens,youth, his family. Overall, the story carefully avoided the obvious andtalked about the things most people wouldn't know about - and that'swhat makes it very interesting. Screenplay (10/10): This is the first time I am sectioning outScreenplay separately in my review because this movie deserved it. Someof the dialogs left a lasting impression - especially the reporterputting out a big IF around the decision to land the plane on Hudson(which was the essence of the movie), or the wife of Sully realizing hewas a part of that 155 endangered lives in that fateful flight. Some ofSully's dialogs to the investigators, which had a hint of sarcasm, werebrilliant. Also, Sully's conversation with Skiles outside theinvestigation room which portrayed his leadership skills was highlyinspirational. Acting (8/10): I don't think anybody could have played this role betterthan Tom Hanks. His expressions and dialog delivery perfectly fit thedemands of the character of an immensely experienced and an honestpilot. Besides him, Aaron Eckhart - playing the role of the firstofficer, assisting the captain - is impressive. Although I felt he waslargely overshadowed by Tom Hanks and barely managed to make hispresence felt. The rest of the cast had a very small screen time tomake any presence felt. Direction (9/10): Clint Eastwood did a great job in keeping this movievery crisp. The idea of narrating the entire incident in pieces wasgreat. More importantly, it was blended very well with the flow of themovie and never felt disruptive. What I also loved was his coverage ofmultiple sub-plots in a short time of 96 minutes while giving perfectjustice to the main plot. However, he probably underutilized AaronEckhart or his character - which was equally involved in the entireincident. Overall (9/10): I loved the movie, or documentary if I may say. A greatwatch - though low on entertainment value - but still a high-qualitycinema."""
7,"""Its a good movie alright, but when I read the wikipedia article aboutthe aftermath events I realized that Clint Eastwood for some reasonwanted to portray the NTSB as devil's advocate or even devils. I amsure Sully did the right thing when he was facing the situation. ButNTSB never accused him of any wrongdoing as shown in the movie. Alsothe simulation details given in the movie are all wrong. The wikiarticle says the below :""The NTSB ran a series of tests using Airbus simulators in France, tosee if Flight 1549 could have returned safely to their choice ofLaGuardia Airport (LGA), either runway 13 or 22, or Teterboro Airport(TEB) runway 19. The test pilots were fully briefed on the series ofevents and maneuvers. The test pilots were only able to returnsuccessfully to either airport in eight of 15 attempts. The NTSB reportnoted that these test conditions were unrealistic: ""The immediate turnmade by the pilots during the simulations did not reflect or accountfor real-world considerations..."" A single follow-up simulation wasconducted where the pilot was delayed by 35 seconds: He crashed tryingto return to LGA runway 22.[96]""Clearly this was not the same as shown in the movie. Shame on you ClintEastwood for doing a very poor job like this! There was no need toglorify Sully by degrading NTSB's actions. Sully did the right thingand he is a hero beyond any doubts. You don't have to prove that bythis cheap tactics!"""
7,"""It's kind of depressing for me to witness a growing contempt inHollywood icon Clint Eastwood. To be clear, all of it is for goodreason. I personally don't care for his political views, nor do Istomach his recent, unpleasant comments on my generation. His 2012support for Mitt Romney hasn't been more than an embarrassment. Hisfilms also haven't reached critical success for a decade and, toppedwith his baggage with the media, still probably won't be for a while.It's a shame that a man who once started out as an out-of-nowhereclassic icon and also a well-acclaimed director will now be rememberedby the new generation as ""that crazy old guy"". Even then, it's still a bummer considering that he's still capable ofmaking great work. He has a great eye for filmmaking and anunrestrained approach to storytelling. His biggest perk is designingsimple yet effective tales out of troubled historical figures. There'sno ""what if"" or ""how come"" in his stories. Just the basic ""it is whatit is"" style of his biopics. Some might complain that there isn't muchmeat to chew on as a result, but what makes Eastwood great as astoryteller lies in the trust he bestows on subjects he feels has justenough resonance on its own. Sometimes that works great (Letters fromIwo Jima) and sometimes it doesn't (J. Edgar). With Sully, which tellsthe story of a recent plane landing on the Hudson River by ChesleySullenberger, he once again reaches that same template with greatearnest to the now-retired hero. The result is a solid,well-intentioned, slightly clumsy, tribute to a historical figure thatno man other than Eastwood can make. Now the life of Sullenberger is a fairly straightforward one. Onceduring a flight in Flight 1549, a major turbulence caused byout-of-nowhere birds forced Sullenberger to attempt a miraculouslanding in the Hudson River. After saving everybody on the plane, he isheld as an ""All American Hero"" even though he just did his job.However, the NTSB, after an investigation on the wreckage, findsevidence to suggest that he committed an irrational act and foundevidence of an alternative and safer method to land the plane. ButSully, along with his co-pilot, suggest that his human instincts pointto the contrary, even going as far as to deny the dozens of flightsimulations against his claim. Is he right? Did he act rationally? Ordoes the big, bad, mean NTSB just trying to tarnish his reputation? Doyou seriously need answers to all of these?Now I know a bunch of smarty pants is bound to compare this to anotherplane movie Flight since both films are about pilots who attemptedmiraculous landings and somehow gets ridiculed for it. But while Flightwas an overrated, unlikeable slog where such a landing can only beachieved by an under-appreciated drunk who shoots up blow and abuseshis friends, Sully takes a simple, likable explanation. He is just aman with past experience with a plane who believes in doing what he canto save as many people as possible, even if it means not landing on arunway. He has a lovable relationship with his wife and kids who getsseparated thanks to a swarm of media news people. He feels that theNTSB forgets the fundamentals of human instinct so much that theywouldn't see the danger of not complying with it. The only piece ofextra information we get is when Sully suffers from reasonablenightmares of the plane crashing which resulted from him not committingto the Hudson in the first place (in beautifully crafted CGI planecrashes). Though otherwise, Clint Eastwood adds little more to thisstory and instead focuses on a man who just simply did his job and getsthe well-deserved hero status, which leads to probably his mostheartwarming piece in his career so far. Sadly, that does lead to a lot of issues. The film's structure is alittle all over the place for starters; Todd Komarnicki's scattershotscreenplay rearranges the events rather than in order, which honestlywould've been the better route. It starts with Sully after the crash,then before, then even back to his younger days, then the events at thehearing. It's a weird structure and it's made worse by the filmdeliberately finding ways to film the crash from multiple angles.Another issue lies in the film being too one-note in its short andsweet storytelling, in which Eastwood frames the NTSB as the bad guyswho misunderstood Sully's act of heroism. It gets reasonable at first,but then once the film shifts into the ""man vs machine"" court case, itgets distracting. I expected that to be the case all along, especiallyfrom a film made by an anti-government conservative, but it's stillunfortunate to see a huge sacrifice in complexity, both in narrativeand in character. Huge issues aside, this is a fine surprise for me and a hugeimprovement for Clint after the two-punch disappointments back in 2014.Tom Hanks is still great in his otherwise straightforward role. The waythe film represents an everyday hero is admirable and sentimental. Theruntime is deliberately shorter so it doesn't overstay its welcome. Andyes, lo and behold, Eastwood amps up the production value in this forthe first time in forever, with simple camera work and impressive CGIplane sequences. In a weekend of sad recognition of 9/11, Sullydeliberately arrives in the right time to remind us about that littleheroic event that's bound to bring us hope in the near future. Shouldthis be Eastwoods last film, it'd be a great closure to an impressivecareer.http://hydebarker.blogspot.com/2016/09/review-sully.html"""
8,"""Excellent film, I left the theatre last night feeling that there washope for the world! During the recent Olympics, every day was awonderful spectacle watching all the events on TV. Then when they wereover, back to the reality of the planet, with tragedy forced down arethroats on the news. But watching Sully restored my faith in theaverage guy doing his job and doing it well. Excellent acting andvisually you really feel you are in the cockpit. I had no idea thatthere had been an inquiry with an attempt to discredit the pilot.Pretty shameful, but the crew stuck together and you can feel andvisualize the powerful effects of excellent team work. Sully alwayscredited his team. This should be required study for all businessschools. Thumbs up to all the actors and director. Interestingreference to ACARS data as well, generally never mentioned in aviationaccidents."""
8,"""Sully is probably one of the most detailed, factually and technicallybrilliant movies ever made of a real life event. Apart from someobvious CGI rendering of the plane which could have been done muchbetter, I was amazed by how Eastwood has given the viewer a clear andaccurate reconstruction of what exactly happened that day and almostfrom every angle.However, having read the book of Sully, ""Highest Duty"", I feel that alot if not most of the message of the movie would have completely goneover my head if I did not read the book. Sully's mentor at a young ageand the story of how he successfully landed a damaged plane in hisearlier military career was perfect from a cinematographic point ofview, but I think it did not convey Sully's message of ""a lifededicated to doing your normal job remarkably"" clearly.I appreciate that the movie tells the untold story of how Sully wasalmost blamed for his heroic actions through the investigation (nottold elsewhere or in ""Highest duty""), but the cheesy ""wife crying onthe phone""-type of storytelling misses an opportunity to inspire theaudience to go home from the cinema and start preparing for their own""land on the Hudson"" moment in their life, something which the book""Highest duty"" most certainly does perfectly.Nonetheless, Sully remains an amazing film which serves as an exampleof what a fine actor Tom Hanks is. I also enjoyed Aaron Eckhart in thisfilm."""
1,"""Have to admit: I was prepared to be cynical and critical about thisfilm, mainly because of my past revulsion to Hollywood's usualabysmally-moronic treatment of commercial aviation (example: acomputer-generated MD-80 defying the principles of aerodynamics andflying inverted in that awful ""Flight"" !). As a former Contributing Editor for the ORIGINAL ""Airways"" magazine(when it was still run by Founding Editor/Publisher John Wegg), Ithought I knew a lot about the topic, as I wrote that magazine's coverfeature-story about the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" incident (it was NEVERa crash).After the first 5 minutes I became a TOTAL BELIEVER in this film, as Isat there, mouth agape and eyes tearing up at HOW WELL DirectorEastwood, star Tom Hanks, and everyone else created AN EXCELLENT ANDCOMPLEX FILM. Why ""complex""? Because it is NOT JUST the water-landing story, butalso:1. the technical perfection of the film, making the flying sequencesand Air Traffic Control sequences spot-on accurate (probably thanks toa lot of technical advisers);2. the courtroom-drama scenario of the NTSB hearings where Sully's andFirst Officer Skiles's careers could have been destroyed had they beenfound guilty of making a bad decision, based upon European airplanemanufacturer Airbus's self-serving inaccurate computer simulations;3. AND, for this proud Manhattanite, the wonderful portrayal of how theNYC ""first responders"" (especially the crews of the New York Waterwaysferries, which were first to reach the floating airliner) reacted tothe incident and kept everyone safe.No one has ever questioned Tom Hanks's acting nor Clint Eastwood'sdirecting, but, as far as this reviewer is concerned, their work inthis film is not only among their best, but is definitely Oscar-worthy."""
9,"""Tom Hanks stars in this portrait of heroic airline pilot Chesley""Sully"" Sullenberger, re-enacting his incredible successful emergencylanding of an Airbus A320 full of passengers on the Hudson River. Ilove Clint Eastwood's direction and this movie is not an exception. Hecreated a film that is vital, intense, thoughtful and emotional. Hanksdoes an admirable job of showing Sully's humiliating stress while hisreputation was being challenged, with the first-rate support of a castthat includes Laura Linney as his wife, and Jamey Sheridan and AnnaGunn. ""Sully"" it is an admiring recreation of the quietly powerful truestory that happened in Hudson and an inspiring film that touches yourheart."""
9,"""Director Clint Eastwood has created a compelling and refreshing look atboth the mental and the physical experience of a national event of anaborted passenger jetliner takeoff and its aftermath occurring in oneof the most populated place on earth. Both the director's incorporationof humanly personal touches and some wonderfully new camera shotperspectives reveal an exciting movie-going experience this heroicincident that is inspiration in its entirety.The editing and use of flashbacks to maintain the pacing andcaptivating questions move the storyline along at a wonderful pace.This is one of those movies where the director's keen talent isrequired to finesse and flesh out a written recollection by the heroicpilot himself onto the big screen. The small shots of the secondary butjust as important humans involved in the rescue and personally touchedby this major bird hit informs the public of a community comingtogether and the teamwork involved in saving the lives of bothpassengers and crew.Clint Eastwood offers up this singular event as in important redemptiveexperience of Americans in light of the tragedy and turmoil that tookplace in this country in the early part of the last decade of the 21stCentury. This movie is a great follow up to Ralph Nelson's 1964fictional airliner investigation thriller Fate is the Hunter or themore haunting supernatural thriller of Rodrigo Garcia's Passengers(2008) and complements the television series Air Disasters (2011) witha fuller personalized background story."""
8,"""I really liked this movie but being a pilot myself I was surprised atwhat was left out of the movie and not mentioned. For instance the airtraffic controller was removed from duty immediately and a blood andurine sample was taken or mentioned to be taken but not from the pilotand the copilot.Also when an aircraft goes down because of two engines failing andshutting down I would think the fuel would be examined and red taggeduntil it was tested safe with no contamination to prevent otheraircraft being fueled with the same fuel from shutting down. That alsowas not addressed. Why Sully nor the co pilot failed to complete andfollow the ditching procedure no one ever will know but that also wasnot mentioned. The procedure specifies that in a water landing that aditching button be activated.The Airbus A320 has a ""ditching"" button that closes valves and openingsunderneath the aircraft, including the outflow valve, the air inlet forthe emergency RAT, the avionics inlet, the extract valve, and the flowcontrol valve.It is meant to slow flooding in a water landing. The flight crew didnot activate the ""ditch switch"" during the incident. To be fair holeswere ripped in the fuselage during the ditching of the aircraft thatopened huge holes that let water seep in but still proper procedure wasnot followed by activating the switch. No one mentioned this during themovie.There is no doubt that both pilots acted professionally and should becommended for safely executing the water landing but it makes onewonder why after all the training and hours they received in trainingand in the cockpit they failed to follow proper procedure.But then again it is said that any landing you can walk away from isconsidered a good one."""
9,"""From what I'd seen of the trailer I was expecting something similar toRobert Zemeckis's Flight. I can gladly report that Sully was a totallydifferent cinematic experience. An inspiring piece of work which is all the more impressive being atrue story. This film did not disappoint. I think it's sometimes easyto watch the news, extract the critical facts of an event and assumethat we know it all. Having sat through this film however I have agreater insight into how things really went down that day.I now have so much more respect for Cpt Sully and the crew of thatflight. It really was nothing short of a miracle that things turned outthe way they did. I would highly recommend this film especially foraviation employees and enthusiasts!"""
8,"""Sully is a biographical drama film starring Tom Hanks and directed byClint Eastwood. Based on the true story of veteran airline pilotChesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the film is a nice tribute to its titlecharacter and the people he saved.Late in the afternoon on January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549departs from LaGuardia Airport in New York to Charlotte DouglasInternational Airport in North Carolina. Three minutes into the flight,the plane is struck by a large flock of birds, which seriously damagesboth its engines. The quick thinking of pilot Chesley ""Sully""Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) results in the plane landing in the middle ofthe freezing cold Hudson River. All 155 passengers and crew survive thecrash landing and Sully is hailed as a hero by the media. However,Sully feels overwhelmed by the sudden fame he has received and to makematters worse, an official investigation is opened over whether or notSully should have acted as he did or if he recklessly endangered thelives of his passengers.Featuring another solid performance by the ever-versatile Tom Hanks andcareful direction by Clint Eastwood, Sully is an interesting look intothe psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero. Theaudience always feels connected to Sully's plight as a reluctant targetof the media and the post-traumatic stress he goes through in theaftermath of the crash. The only major issue I had with the film isthat the supporting characters did not have much to work with. It justseemed like most of their dialogue was there merely to enhance thecharacter development of Sully himself rather than to bring a differentperspective to the story.I rate it 7.5/10"""
9,"""While this may not be Hank's most demanding role, I think it willcertainly be one of his most memorable, along with ""Forrest Gump"" and""Saving Private Ryan"". And Eastwood met the challenge of telling thetruth of the story in an engaging way without loosing the audience intedium or BS. And I was glad to see that serious attention was paid toaeronautical reality in a movie--for a change. For those interested inhow well the movie does stick to the facts, re: the go to source forthat, http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/sully/ . For me, oneof the two highlights of the film was what happened after the aircraftwas ditched, in how the passengers didn't panic, and how well therescue effort went. The other was the climax with Sullenberger's &Skiles testimony before the NTSB investigation (read ""trial"") which wasin a much larger venue than I would have thought.The one thing the movie (and the actual investigation, apparently)didn't cover was how things are changed when making a dead-stick (nothrust) landing in an airliner, which without thrust, have been likenedto flying a brick. With a runway, you have only one shot aiming for aspecific point--in this case surrounded by many tall buildings, andthey didn't exactly have much time to see how far they could glideanyway. Better to have something flat, very wide and very very long,even if it is wet. The space shuttle is the only large aircraft thatroutinely does (or did) dead stick landings; and that's with muchstudy, training, practice, and (at least at first) landing on a drylake bed--offering plenty of wiggle-room.What Sullenberger told 60 Minutes had to have been going through hishead that day, ""The only viable alternative, the only level, smoothplace sufficiently large to land an airliner, was the river"". The onlysemi-error they made was not to hit the ditch button which would havesealed the vents in the airplane (though the tail section was breachedon landing) because it was at the end of the checklist which theydidn't have time to complete. They made a big deal out of his startingthe aux power unit (APU) out of checklist order. Just sayin'. Thatshould have been the co-pilots's cue when Sully looks at him 10 secondsbefore ditching and asks, ""Any ideas?"". (A ""DITCH"" button, who'd'vethunk.)"""
6,"""Remember when a plane flew into the Hudson Bay? Remember all 155passengers on board who miraculously survived the impact? Remember thepilot responsible for making the quick move that prevented this delayfrom becoming a disaster? ​ Now, seven and a half years after theseevents shook the world, the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger isbrought to the screen by director Clint Eastwood and actor Tom Hanks.Based on the autobiography, ""Highest Duty,"" Sully expresses how thepassengers' fear was vanquished by their pilot's risky andcontroversial thinking in a fashion that will inspire dads and businessprofessionals across the nation.It begins with a nightmare by the infamous pilot of his airplane flyinguncontrollably into the city, the sounds of the plane booming realenough to rattle you the right way. He wakes up to yet another newsreport of his catastrophic Flight 1549 landing from January 15, 2009.This reality is simply too overwhelming for him to handle, so much so,that he can't even go jogging without facing a near-hit by a taxi cab.Neither he nor his family can escape from the reporters, talk shows,and high city court who won't shut up about the controversy. It'salmost as if 911 is happening all over again, except consequentially byone of America's own heroes.He explains in flashback precisely why he allowed the landing in spiteof claims that the left engine could still have been idling. It allfollows a nonlinear storytelling structure similar to what StanleyKubrick or Quentin Tarantino have popularized. Maybe this flashbackstructure wasn't necessary in the telling of the story, or maybe itjust wasn't edited properly. But either way, it got frustratinglyconfusing as to where or when I was in time, especially when it returnsme to a scene that if left off of a half hour earlier.If you were to go ask anyone who was there on that day of the HudsonBay landing, they would go on to say from backed up evidence that theseevents are true to what happened; but this retelling doesn't feel quitetrue enough. Even right from the release of the first trailer, I knewthat Tom Hanks wasn't going to fit the part, particularly because hedoes not look the part at all. Basically all the makeup artists do tomake him look authentic is spray-paint his hair white and glue amustache onto his face, which looks completely unconvincing that he isrepresenting the real flight hero. Then if you look everywhere elsearound him, there is an excessive amount of branding for New York'sculture. The words ""New York"" are everywhere within the overusedwide-shots of the city, something that not even the fake-looking CGIplanes can distract us from.Yet I still wouldn't say that it makes this a horrible viewingexperience. Far from it, in fact. Sully is backed up with plenty ofsatisfactory performances by the whole cast, particularly Aaron Eckhart(The Dark Knight, Thank You for Smoking), who plays CaptainSullenberger's first officer and best friend. There's also Laura Linney(Mystic River, The Truman Show) who plays the captain's stay- at- homewife. She's not the most well-developed or memorable of characters, buther love for her husband still comes out satisfactorily well.Yeah, that's a good word to sum up this movie. It's satisfactory. It'scertainly better than average, but not the best thing ever like I hopedit would. It's just plain satisfactory as good, wholesome,inspirational entertainment. It's not that bad for tributing a man whowas so big he had an alcoholic beverage named after him (it's made witha shot of Grey Goose Vodka and a splash of water, so feel free to makeit at home!)It's also worth noting that the end credits feature some special guestappearances who will make this entire movie truly worth the trip."""
9,"""I'm gonna go straight to the review without telling its plot. In thisfilm.Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckart performance were great. Clint Eastwood did agreat job stretching the story from the Plane scene, court scene andSully's little background story. I love the editing of the film and thescreenplay. It's not a linear storytelling but it works well showingsome flashbacks and visions. I like also how they add some humor inthis film. Cinematography was good. I didn't experience it on IMAXbecause there's no IMAX theater nearby do i watch it on 2D they saidthat the plane scene was good in IMAX in 2D looks good. Overall it is a worth watching movie. If you love drama films you'regonna love this but if you love films with explosions and a non-stopaction this film is not for you. It's about human, human who makesdecisions. This films is not just about Sully but also the other peopleinvolved in the rescue in the Hudson River.Can't wait to watch it again in DVD or Blu-ray If you haven't seen it go watch it and you're gonna love it too. 9/10"""
7,"""Clint Eastwood does a great job by depicting chains of events throughhis timeline. Tom Hanks was as usual great and portrayed Sullyamazingly. Sully goes through a lot of emotional stress and starts todoubt his own decisions while standing confident with the governmentabout his decisions. He is shown as a family man who keeps his wifeupdated on everything that goes around but nothing else was shown abouthis daughter or wife or how their life was impacted through this. Theydid show some glimpse of Sully as a young pilot as a soldier and as akid when he use to fly with his dad. Though they could have added moreto those context, the film only seemed to focus on the crash mainly.The crash into Hudson was showed nicely but rest of the story couldhave been better. It really didn't have anything new to offer than justSully's emotional state of mind regarding the crash and some issueswith his decision making. Decision making process also seemed to lastreally short, only like 2-3 scenes. This movie does a great job withsound editing and everything else , if you are hoping to see somethingnew to the story then this might not be something you want to wastemoney on this, but if you just want to go enjoy yourself, then sure goahead. I wish they would have made this movie a bit longer and add moreviews to it rather than just sully. His co-pilot didn't have much toadd to this story than just being a witnessing the crash, we don'treally get to know what he went through. but how much ever they showedof the story, was shown beautifully. So do go watch this if you don'tknow the story."""
5,"""The movie tells the true story of what happened January 15, 2009. It isabout when Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed U.S. Airways flight 1549onto the Hudson River. Many people called this ""Miracle on the Hudson""but the maximum of them do not know what actually happened. Mr. Sully,this national hero was also being investigated for his actions on thatday which put his career in peril. this movie tells the whole story ofthis investigation and how Mr. Sully struggled and to deal with the newfound honor and the stress of post-trauma and the crash had on him andhis crew.This is a Clint Eastwood movie and Tom Hanks starring the central roleSully. He portrayed the role Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger very nicelyand think he really deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. No doubtthat Tom Hanks is a very talented actor and again he proves this. AaronEckhart as Jeff Skiles has also done a good job. But the main hero isTom Hanks. He acted naturally when the plane landed and his bravery wasvery good at the screen. He made sure all the 155 passengers were goodand this sequence of the movie was very good and really worth watching.Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles who was in the cockpit on thatday and he also has done a nice job and his comedic delivery was good.Clint Eastwood's direction was OK but nothing to shout about. He hasmade a much better movie than this and this is not his best effort. Ithink the script is a little bit choppy and slow and the characterdevelopment not so imposing for a true story. I am not telling this is a bad movie but if you want to spend time ormoney on it, you please think before investing. This is a very verygood choice for DVD but in theatres may be you will not enjoy this."""
5,"""It's late and I'm tired, so I will keep this short and sweet. In a nutshell, it's boring, particularly as we already know the outcome fromthe very beginning of the movie. (The plane crash lands in the Hudsonriver, in case you didn't know. Ooops, Spoiler alert)This movie documents the aftermath of the ""landing"" more than theactual event itself and it doesn't really do much of a job at that. Theintentions are clearly to take you through the emotions and strainplaced upon the captain in the aftermath of the event.Simply put, there just isn't enough substance to really create a storyline out of this. The most similar comparison of such a story linewould be the movie; Flight, with Denzel Washington. That does a farbetter job of what was intended here. As an avid movie enthusiast, I'mconfident they could have done a better job here, but to me that goeswithout saying, especially when given a cowardly run time of 136minutes."""
3,"""i think an 8th grader wrote this script. the bottom line is the entire""conflict"" in this story is that the government agencies investigatedthe water landing. ummmmm...yeah. that is their job. thedialogue...wow....poor. the action scenes were OK, but the sound trackwas too loud and offensive. Look, make movies that people want to see.it is not really that difficult. there were probably a lot of storiesaround the people on the plane that went untold. we have all matured alittle beyond the evil conspiracy by the big bad government plots. theyare boring. tired. old. Somewhat like the director. don't waste yourmoney. i only went because my in laws wanted to see it."""
5,"""on scale of one to jelly this movie comes up as peanut butter. TomHanks does a wonderful job of portraying my father the day of theincident.

Maybe if thelighting in the plane was better during the crash seen you could focusmore on Hanks than his surrounding. His straight face expression givesyou everything you need to know but I don't think its as noticeable asit should"""
1,"""I was initially wondering how they would make a 30 minute event into afull-length feature. But then I remember, this is Hollywood--they cando whatever they want.Sully is based on the true story of 2009's ""Miracle on the Hudson""where Captain Chesley Sullenberger had to safely land a plane after aflock of geese flew into both engines, causing them to fail.The event was traumatic enough, but this film mostly details theairline investigation following the incident. Director Clint Eastwoodwisely circles the narrative around, sprinkling the action amidst thedrama, keeping the pacing up and saving us from having to experience along, uninterrupted National Transportation Safety Board hearing.Throughout the film, Sullenberger is seen interacting with his wife,played by Laura Linney, on the phone. It's an interesting choice not tohave them face to face in person. I've struggled to find a good reasonwhy. Perhaps keeping them apart is to emphasize the film's ""delay isbetter than disaster"" theme. Or maybe it's to distance Sully from hisfamily and show how he just longs to be home, creating irony around howhe was nearly never to be home again. Or it might just be aninteresting quirk that Eastwood decided to include. Whatever it is,it's unique and adds to the film's appeal.Perhaps the only thing that's distracting, though, is Linney's acting.It might seem like it's good on the surface. She shows a lot ofemotion, yet is strong when she needs to be, but her delivery is justso off much of the time. It's not believable. It feels like she knowsshe's acting and is trying her best to sell it. Maybe it's because shewas acting into a phone the whole time.But that's a minor setback. The film is uplifting, just like the 2009event itself. It gives us a glimpse inside the mind of an Americanhero. A normal, everyman who lifted our country's spirits during a timewhen we really needed it. The film doesn't ruffle any feathers. Nordoes it ever really make you ever second-guess our protagonist--whichis for the best, I think, in this situation. But it takes what it hasand does its very best turning the material into one heck of an ode toa memorable person and event of the early 21st century.Twizard Rating: 98"""
9,"""Sully!!!It was Jan 2009 when I was all ready to come to Oman and Sullyhappened! The news was all over TV. An Airbus 320 had actually 'landed'on a river! And all were alive! In the coming days, the miracle wouldbe written and spoken about across the globe.And now in 2016, when I had first seen the trailer of Sully, I knewthis was a movie I cannot afford to miss. Then the added excitement ofthe opening of the first IMAX in Oman and sully being the first film.So here it was, my first IMAX experience and that to with Sully. Sully, played by Tom Hanks is nothing short of a great movie ever made.Forget the incident and its re-creation. It was all about ChesleySullenberger, the Captain of the flight, whose presence of mind, gritand above all experience saved everyone on that flight. Not once did Iremember Tom Hanks (well, maybe the first scene). His conviction of theroles he plays is really stupendous. The movie enacts what happens andgoes to show what transpired thereafter which only a few might be awareof. The movie shows, how the lives of 155 individuals collaborates towardsone destiny on that day. The worries, thoughts, tension, rememberingtheir loved ones, prayers, all captured in those few moments when theaircraft is poised as if in time, before the ultimate undecided moment.The big screen experience really made me live the scenes. Being aflying enthusiast and a flight simmer myself, I really freaked out atall the cockpit scenes and shots.What more would you expect from the Daddy of Cinema, Clint Eastwoodhimself? The direction, editing, acting is truly flawless. Enjoyedevery frame of this movie.A Hollywood production you ideally should not miss. And if you have theopportunity to see it in IMAX, don't miss it. As it has been shot onIMAX and the scenes are tailor-made to be enjoyed there. A story youwould never want to live but definitely want to know, what hadhappened!Rajesh Sharma @rajrad"""
8,"""I am a sucker for true story movies. I just love them. There issomething about learning about an event or someone's life that is justinteresting to me. Sully is no different. As I don't live in America, Ihad known about the plane landing in the river however my knowledge ofthe event stopped there. I really enjoyed this movie. I'll admit, it was a little different tohow I thought it was going to be but it was different in a good way.Eastwood found a way to bring this movie to a human level. By this Imean he was able to tell the story of the crash and the events thatfollowed through they eyes of multiple people involved. This made thefilm really relatable being able to see the point of view from Sullyhimself, the passengers and the crew on board the plane as well as theserve crew that were apart of the rescue.Another this Eastwood does is that I really enjoyed was the way thisfilm was complied. He does something interesting where the film jumpsback and forth between the crash itself, the investigation afterwardsand past life experiences of Sully. I think this really kept the movieinteresting because we got to see how there is so many factors thatplay into the movie. What was surprising about this was it didn't feelrepetitive in anyway. When you see the plane crash for the third orfourth time, each time you feel like you are seeing somethingdifferent. This is because you get the same event from multiple pointsof view like I mentioned before.Credit also has to be given to Tom Hanks. I thought his really nailedthe emotional side this is film surprisingly has. The way he portraysthe character during the immediate events after the crash was reallyfantastic and he had your full attention every scene he was in.8/10"""
9,"""Really you have Tom Hanks and that over in that of Clint Eastwood whohas put his acting career or shelved it to concentrate on directing. Hanks plays Chelsey Sully Sullenberger, the heroic pilot and AaronEckhart plays his first mate, Jeff Skyles. Both are heroes to thepublic and passengers.But not to the N.T.S.B. as that thinks it is pilot error and that theyquestion both men. And that pilot error would end both of theircareers.But both stick to their guns amid the stress of the investigation andthink that they did the right thing. In the aftermath of landing theplane and saving all 155 lives on board.Tom Hanks will again be Oscar nominated. And it would be adisappointment if he was not having been passed for ""Captain Philipsand Bridge of Spies!""Eckhart character tries to bring out the best in Hanks Sully. But stillit is a great film."""
7,"""People often forget that when their riding an airplane (specifically, acommercial airliner), their sitting on top of a major carrier of fuelthat it were to crash, would likely explode. This shouldn't discouragepeople from flying as such a profession requires finding everythingthat could go wrong and making sure nothing can happen. Aside fromterrorists that have tragically used them as weapons, most planecrashes tend to be mechanical. Engineers before the takeoff can findmost of these glitches. In the case of something going wrong in theair, most planes can simply head back to their original airport and tryto land at a nearby one. If all of the above is available, then the people on the plane betterhope that the pilot can find a place to land. Though these thingsrarely happen, most of these forced landings or crashes tend to endbadly. Though there is the occasional miracle.In 2009, a US Airways plane was forced to make a water landing whentheir engine was struck by birds. Not only did the plane land alright,but Captain Chesley Sullenberger managed to save everyone on board. Thestory of that crash and the aftermath are the subject of Sully.As history is recreated, we see Captain Chesley Sullenberger (played byTom Hanks) and his first Officer Jeffrey Skiles (played by AaronEckhart) getting ready to depart from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte,North Carolina. For Sully, this is just another routine flight in histhirty years of flying experience. He's discussed retirement soon sothat he can spend more time with his wife Lorraine (played by LauraLinney) and his two daughters. Just as his flight is ascending, bothengines are struck by a flock of birds, rendering them broken with theplane unable to restart them.He makes the decision to water land after deciding that trying to getback to LaGuardia or another airport was not doable. Though the crewand passengers are frightened, Sully manages to get them all outsafely. Sully is seen as a hero by the press and get's several bookingsto talk about it from Katie Couric to David Lettermen. Though sufferingpost traumatic stress and experiencing nightmares, he seems to bepulling through. The National Transportation Safety Board isinvestigating whether Sully had made the right call and even holds alarge meeting to determine whether his decision was correct or heshould give up his wings (doing so would prevent retirement pension).Sully sounds straightforward and it pretty much is the kind ofreenactment one would expect. Given the Hollywood budget, they managegive us a pretty good sequence of the plane landing in the water andthe rescue of the people. Though a good part of the movie is about thatcrash, the real focus of the story is surrounding Sully's aftermath andthe investigation he was under. With the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" storysurrounding the press, I had no idea that Sully was questioned abouthis actions. Director Clint Eastwood brings the same dark style that he brought toGran Torino and Jersey Boys and I think he finally understands that toomuch of it makes the experience unpleasant. The story is short at onlyan hour and a half, but it's the right length. Though it's story isgood, the editing is very odd. There are several moments where itchooses to sporadically cut to Sully's youth or of the crash. Some areshort, but some are very long, which makes you question just what theintention of the flow was. I think this would have been better had itbeen shown straightforward without the time jumps.I'll give this seven airline captains hats out of ten. In the end, Iwas glad that I saw this miracle on the Hudson story to life. While notnecessarily a strong commentary about the airline industry nor a diveinto captain psyche, Sully is an engaging story about one man'sdecision. Plus with Tom Hanks, you know you're gonna get a goodperformance. I'd say check it out if you heard about the story andwanted to know more. Board on and hope for the best."""
8,"""Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) has been flying since he was a teenagecrop duster. Now after a gazillion flights, he takes the controls againwith his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) on a cold January day.But, alas, almost immediately after takeoff, a flock of geese fly intothe engines, disabling both of them. As experienced pilots, both knowhow far a plane can fly to land. The air traffic controller offers areturn to LaGuardia and a nearby Jersey airport. But, within a fewseconds, Sully deems these choices impossible. The glorious Hudsonriver stretches out in front of them and Sully makes a MIRACULOUSlanding in the water. Then, at once, the plane is taking water and the155 passengers have to be rushed to the inflatable lifeboats and waitto be rescued by the Coast Guard. They are, all of them. Yet, Sully andSkiles must spend a few days in New York while the NSA begins toquestion their judgments on landing in the water. While Sully is a heroto the passengers, crew, and the whole world, the NSA bigwigs try totell him he should have headed for the airports. Simulations show theycould have made it. Aghast, Sully and Jeff counter that it wasimpossible. Further tests are ordered while Sully's wife (Laura Linney)is waiting for him, anxious and afraid his career will be over. Willit? This fine, 90 minute film is exciting and maddening. Hanks gives agreat performance, making you forget everything but that he is Sully.Eckhart, Linney, and all of the others support him wonderfully. WhenEastwood recreates the water landing, it is terrifying and amazing.But, how annoying it is that the NSA is slow to thank this great pilotand quick to doubt his abilities and decisions. Its probably routinebut it sure doesn't seem like it. Audiences will like the NYC settingwith lots of great views from the air, too. Inventive, also, is thedirector's choice to unfold the film, not chronologically, but in jumpsbetween past and present. All in all, this is another masterful film byMs. Clint Eastwood. See it, see it!"""
7,"""Most people in the western world saw or heard about the miracle of theHudson, where captain Sullenberger managed to land his severely damagedairplane on the Hudson river without any casualties. The film centerson Sullenberger and the crash investigation that questioned his choiceto land on the river instead of returning to nearby airports.With a relatively short run-time of 96 minutes it surprised me how richa story Eastwood managed to make. With clever non-linear storytellingand repeating events from multiple perspectives he puts out a strongand compelling story.Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as the captain Sullenberger, Aaron Eckhartwho plays the part of co-pilot, does not get the chance to shineunfortunately."""
9,"""Many people think of Clint Eastwood as a legend. Myself included. At anage when most Hollywood personalities are turning senile, Eastwood isstill churning out auteur stuff. At its heart, Sully is a modestcelebration of an All American hero, much like Eastwood's previous filmAmerican Sniper. Modest and celebration go hand-in-hand, like anoxymoron, because in reality, the message in this film is much largerthan it appears on screen.Consider the fact that Captain Sullenberger (again, Hanks at hisbrilliant yet modest best) had decades of experience as a pilot beforethe incident. Not a blemish in his career having flown over a millionpassengers safely in 42 years as a commercial pilot. That's anextraordinary feat for anyone in the aviation industry. But all thatwas almost instantly tarnished when bigwigs from the NTSB took over theinvestigation. They wanted to blame someone. Somehow his years ofdevotion to the job didn't matter. In their books Sullenberger didn'tfollow procedure. Herein lies the crux of the film based on the realincident that occurred on 15 Jan 2009 - instinct versus experienceversus procedure. Could Sullenberger have saved the lives of all 155souls on board that day had he followed procedure? The answer to thatquestion is almost terrifying, not only in the film, but also to anyoneconfined to the nitty-gritties of hardcore airport and flight ops. Andthat's probably why the incident has been dubbed the 'Miracle on theHudson'.There's a lot of liberty compressing months of investigation into ashort 95 minutes of screen time. But that also means there's not asingle minute wasted in telling this remarkable story. Apart from acouple of stock scenes showing panic stricken passengers, Sully is asremarkable as the story it depicts. This is not only Eastwood at hisno-nonsense best, it's a steadfast salute to professionalism, both onscreen and in reality. It's a director's film through and through so Iwon't be surprised if Sully gets a nod for a Best Picture nomination atthe Oscars. And then some."""
8,"""The trailer does a good job at adding suspense to the film, and whileit is exciting at times, the film overall has a feel of an educationalvideo. Because it centers around a specific event, the filmconcentrates on showing us the before, during, and after scenes of thatpivotal decision. Sully is a good watch, however, you might come outnot thinking you watched a movie. Hanks and Eckhart do great together. Both totally embody theircharacters, so much so, that I did not even recognize them. Morespecifically Eckhart, because Hanks is recognizable anywhere. Theemotions, especially that of intense thought from Hanks, is well done.Not only does Hanks portray his character's emotions well, but thefilm- making overall, does an incredible job at magnifying thoseemotions. Eastwood has done well in directing this film. In most cases,frequently jumping between the past, the event, and the present, can beconfusing. However, it worked well for this movie. By not giving us allthe details of one timeline at once, it adds more suspense to themovie. Also, the crafting of certain words and scenes makes theaudience think in different directions. So, while the story is based ona true story, and seems to be quite accurate, it is rather thrillingthe way in which it insinuates different outcomes. Overall, a well made film that was educational as well as a littlethrilling. On the down side, I watched this in AVX (my first time), andwas quite disappointed. It was not worth the extra money."""
8,"""Considering this is based on Sully's book, with the very capable ClintEastwood Directing, I expected this movie the to make an impact.Mission Accomplished, and then some.The film is designed like an onion. It opens with a nightmare by Sullycrashing his plane, then it winds back into the aftermath of the crash,then it winds back to the crash, and then winds up to the aftermath,then back to the crash, and then finally to the hearing after thecrash. It does so flawlessly like peeling back that onion and exposingmore and more about the story.Sully's relationship with his co-pilot is the most exposed part ofthis. Sully's relationship with his wife and family, is told smartlythough it is more just between him and his wife. It mentions thedaughters but that is all. The most difficult thing it does well is the recreation of the crash.Sully puts in just enough about the passengers to make it feel real butnot more than is needed. It dramatizes the relations between Sully andthe NTSB investigation a bit more for dramatic effect, but is just theright touch. The hero's on the river who got to the plane quickly sothat everyone is saved is done just right.Tom Hanks is very effective, which is almost always true, as Sully. Thefilm does actually get over the feeling of how Sully was treated as ahero by everyone after the crash, not an easy thing to do, brings thehero feeling into reality.This film makes a point about computer information which is veryrelevant here. Any computer information is only a good as what isprogrammed into it. When a computer is used to simulate anything, itmust have real data put into it to get real data out. That piece ofdrama dominates the closing of this one.Is it worth seeing? This movie makes my day, punks, but I leave it upto you to decide if I have fired enough data into this to make yourday, too."""

The slightly non-chronological order does notaffect the story, as most people would have already heard what happenedon the news. I find the story very engaging, and I really feel forCaptain Sully. He acts honourably and makes critical decisionsdecisively, saving all people on board the aircraft. Yet, thesubsequent investigation is so unfair, without any consideration of hispast accomplishments and without respect. The undue pressure from theunnecessary fault finding exercise simply puts professionals off theirwork. I can relate to his predicament, that he has to fight for justiceand his honour just because something goes wrong beyond his control. Ifprofessionals are discouraged from working and serving the society, oursocieties will simply not function.""Sully"" brought tears to my eyes. Clint Eastwood makes yet another filmthat moves me to tears."""

Use of flashbacks was brilliant conceptfor an engaging audience till the climax. Great performance fromEckhart and Linney, too. Simulation thing added some entertainment inthe second half.

Clearly this was with great skill anddetermination that this happened and the film shows these scenes withgreat drama and skill.

I can't imagine that Iwould be so panic. But I can see, Capt. Sully is an extraordinarycaptain, who is very determined and responsible for the lives ofpassengers. To be the last man standing, reassure that no one leftbehind. Tom Hanks portrait Sully so brilliantly, and so did Eckhart.The way when they're on NTSB hearing was so calm and when Sully toldthe audience about human being factor is so touching. I never knew thatthere's such a heroic action on 2009, until this film is released. Thisis a must see film."""
7,"""Since around the year 2000, I've adopted a rule to see any film ClintEastwood has been involved with, and largely that is a rule that hasproved fruitful. Sully, the 2016 film directed by Eastwood, was anothershining example of the mastery of Eastwood behind the lens. StarringTom Hanks in the titular role, along with Aaron Eckhart as the co-pilot no one knows, Sully tells the story of the miraculous landing ofa US Airways flight on the Hudson River in 2009. Audiences everywhereremember that fateful day, and can recall being captivated by thenewsreel footage that overtook American TV screens; what we didn'tknow, however, was the tumult Captain Sullenberger endured with theNational Transportation Safety Board. Exposing this untold aspect ofthe story, and delving deeper into the psyche of the veteran pilotafter his difficult landing, makes Sully a film not to be missed.Thursday, January 15th, 2009, is a day that started off like any otherworkday for Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Sully) (Tom Hanks) the42-year veteran pilot. After settling into the cockpit for anotherflight, Sully performs all of his pre-flight checklist with firstofficer, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). When all systems are go, Sullyand the crew take off with 155 total people on board the plane. Momentsafter takeoff, a flight of Canadian geese fly straight towards theplane disabling both engines. As everything begins to fail, Sully makesthe decision to reroute back to LaGuardia where the plane departedfrom. When the plane loses thrust and altitude at an alarming rate,Sully decides they will not be able to make it back to the airport, andis now faced with how to execute an emergency landing and save as manypeople on board as he possibly can. The only option that seemsavailable to Sully is to attempt a landing on the Hudson River. Anunprecedented water landing is, by no means, an easy undertaking,especially on a frigid 20-degree day. Sully did the unthinkable, notonly successfully landing the aircraft, but doing so with no loss oflife. Remaining on board until the last possible moment, making sureall passengers were off the plane, then taking the flight manifest withhim to be able to account for all the passengers, Sully acted as a truecaptain to every soul who happened to board U.S. Airways flight 1549.That's the part of the story the audience knows, what we didn't knowwas the tumult Sullenberger went through with the NationalTransportation Safety Board, who was dealing with the insurance falloutfollowing such an emergency landing. The ensuing investigationthreatened to ruin Sullenberger's career and his burgeoning aviationsafety consulting business. The investigation threatened Sully'slifework, and pension, all while being touted as a national hero.Sullenberger fought for his livelihood while dealing with thedebilitating fallout of the traumatic experience he endured. It is easyto think about the passengers onboard the flight and the harrowingexperience they went through, but it is easy to forget that CaptainSullenberger went through the same traumatic experience, with the addedstress of being responsible for every life on board, as well. Anamazing insight to the man who captivated a nation, Sully is sure togain some Oscar buzz, and one not to be missed. Clint Eastwood attempts the incredibly difficult task of taking a storythat everyone knows and telling it in a captivating way. Eastwooddefinitely achieves this feat, as the audience is on the edge of theirseat, even though they already know the outcome of the story. Eastwood,choosing to inject the following NTSB investigation into CaptainSullenberger's actions was a stroke of brilliance, allowing theaudience to become engrossed and possibly enraged with another aspectof his heroic story, that we may not otherwise have known. I am no fanof Tom Hanks, I actually prefer to only watch him in a movie if I canforget that he is the actor I am watching on screen; that being said,Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Captain Sullenberger. He embodiesthe extremely focused, almost militant Sullenberger in a fantastic way.Aaron Eckhart was also a brilliant selection for the strong supportingrole of the first officer who was a necessity to Sullenberger'sunprecedented landing. Sound acting choices and the brilliance of ClintEastwood behind the camera create a wonderful story of one man's heroicfeat that gave New York some much needed plane-related good news."""
8,"""This film is unlike any other, that Clint Eastwood, the 86 years oldlegendary director and actor created so far, due to it's style and it'slength. The full length of Sully (including the rolling cast) is only96 minutes, making this feature the shortest film Eastwood everdirected. This is mainly because that the movie was shot entirely withIMAX 65 cameras, which makes a lot of extra work in post-production,such as in color grading and removing the background noise. Althoughit's relatively short screen time, the movie is still slow pacedcompared to other airplane dramas, for example Robert Zemeckis' Flight(2012). The acting is superb. Tom Hanks is excellent as usually, bringingnearly the same level as in Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips or in RonHoward's Apollo 13. I only seen Aaron Eckhart one time acting betterthan his role in Sully, and that's his awesome performance as HarveyDent's complex character in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. The direction is amazing, as we except from an Eastwood movie. In thisfilm, he focused more on the visuals than in the actors and emotions,which he usually do. Although I prefer his more human-oriented dramas,it was interesting to see him directing a feature like this. This movie is a must see for those, who like Clint Eastwood, and forthose, who love slow-paced dramas. Overall, I think this film is not asgood as Flight (I think Flight is the only movie I can compare withSully from the 2010s), but Sully is definitely a must see. 8/10"""
8,"""As a pilot for 40 years I really enjoyed Sully as I'm sure most pilotsdid also. Since the actual flight was so short it would have been niceto have seen an uninterrupted view of the flight from take-off to thewater landing from the cockpit perspective. Instead we got a lot ofshort edits jumping back and forth from the cockpit, to the cabin andthen outside.That's a small complaint though. A larger one is how poorly the NTSBwas treated as arrogant and oblivious to the human factors involved inan unprecedented emergency involving dual engine failure at 2,800 feet.I understand every drama needs an antagonist and maybe only the NTSBcould have played that role in Sully. Just understand that's showbusiness. Pilots might have the occasional complaint with the FAA, say,during a ramp inspection, but the NTSB is pretty much universallyrespected as one of the most capable and thorough agencies within thefederal government. The incredible safety record of American air travelis largely attributable to the NTSB and the FAA.Google ""ntsb final report USAir 1549"" to read the final NTSB report onthe flight. Judge for yourself. This wasn't written by a bunch ofarrogant bureaucrats.One other thought. If you liked the pilot heroics in Sully, watch ""TheHigh and the Mighty"" filmed in 1954. Great music, visuals and JohnWayne showing how iron-jawed pilots handle emergencies."""
8,"""Sully explores the events of an A320's emergency landing 'not a crash'on the Hudson River. This is shown in a variety of perspectivesthroughout the movie including passengers, citizens on land, boats,aircraft control centres and of course, Sully's. The movie examines theevents after the incident involving when all the passengers make it toshore, and days after the event. Sully also has nightmares and visionsof him crashing into the city which may be distressing for someviewers. Sully is forced to deal with the aircraft investigation teamwho state that Sully could have landed at an airport instead of theriver. The movie also explores some of Chesley's 'Sully' background andprevious events including his life in the air-force and a jet incidentwhere he was forced to land. Sully was a well made movie and gave arealistic take on the events that occurred on January the 15 2009 andexplained the story very well to foreign viewers who were unfamiliarwith the events."""

Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), who, on Jan. 15, 2009,attempted an emergency landing on New York's Hudson River after the USAirways Flight 1549 he was commanding struck a flock of geese.Miraculously _ too miraculously, some FAA investigators believe _ allof the 155 passengers and crew survive the harrowing ordeal, andSullenberger becomes a national hero in the eyes of the public and themedia.However, despite the accolades, and away from the adoring public, thepilot faces a wrenching investigation that threatens to destroy hiscareer and reputation.Director Clint Eastwood demands, and gets, natural, realisticperformances from his actors, top to bottom, in a film shot in analmost-throwback semi-documentary fashion.In his typical understated, signature master-storytelling style,Eastwood successfully explores a sobering backstory about the rigorsand costs of sudden-found fame, with a subtle indictment of the mediaand its rush-to-judgment approach that too often becomes a catalyst ofthe story it's covering.One of Hanks' best, and Aaron Eckhart, in a welcome relief frommenacing villains he plays so well, is excellent as his supportiveco-pilot. Laura Linney is her usual superb self as Sully's wife, whotries to manage the ups and downs of the family crisis on the homefront while her husband is away.Enlightening and entertaining, with no dead spots. Well worth yourtime."""
9,"""Tom Hanks has some kind of magic that we see in all his movies. Thedefinition of the word HERO can be extracted after seeing this movie.This is now one of his masterpiece.Tom Hank has played his role almost without emotion but because of hisinterpersonal skills (the real Sully) this works out almost perfectly.Movies of this kind that are based on real life events have a grip onour mind which makes us watch the movie till the last minute andcreates an impression on everyone who sees it.But the censor board giving an A rating which is a little strangething.

8,"""Sully is an emotional film with amazing performances. Tom Hanks asalways was brilliant, this man could not fail to embody a role. Ithought that it was very interesting that instead of reciting theevents of the water landing we also got to see the aftermaths andoutcomes of the event. This is one of Clint Eastwood's shortest filmsand I think this sort of length is much better as the long run timessometimes really makes the film drag for quite a bit, so that is onegood thing that came out of the film.One of my favourite parts of the movie was that we were not given oneside to root for throughout the film, we got both sides of the argumentand at times either sides to the argument seemed very plausible andmade a lot of sense. This really got audiences thinking, 'was itcaptain Sully making everyone at risk by performing a water landing?Could he really have made it back to the airport under the conditions?'It was very interesting to get to see and analyze for yourself insteadof the film shoving it in your face.This film really captures the best qualities of people, how when facinga common threat people would band together and collaborate and supporteach other. All 155 passengers and crew were saved and have survivedthe landing, not only due to captain Sully's landing and experiencesbut is really this joint effort of policeman, fireman and all thepeople who came together in the light of need. This could be a verypowerful message and imagery that is very empowering and a veryimportant part of the real life event that the film capturesimpeccably."""
8,"""Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks come together in this powerful true storyabout the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" and it truly is a miraculous movie.From Eastwood's deft camera-work to the subtle acting and music and thelimited use of special effects all in an amazing tale of heroicendeavor in midair.Tom Hanks is perfectly in the titular role of Captain Chesley ""Sully""Sullenberger. Hanks aptly portrays the wisdom of Sullenberger's 40+years of piloting experience with ever breaking his calm demeanor.Maintaining his position on the course of action he undertook on thefateful day of January 15, 2009, Sully ultimately proved his actionswere justified in saving 155 passengers. This is a tour de forceperformance by the legendary Oscar winner and his chemistry with fellowactor Aaron Eckhart (as First Officer Jeff Skilles) is spot-on.The narrative is straightforward in telling of Captain Sully's heroicmaneuver after a bird strike destroyed his plane's engines. Theinvestigation of the crash portion of the film is really condensed (dueto time constraint obviously) in order to keep the film's run-timeshort. What is kept in the film is still golden material and does notdumb down the amazing feat that Captain Sully achieved. Truly one of Clint Eastwood's best films to date."""
9,"""Clint Eastwood likes to depict real-life Americans under pressure whosave the day. Notorious FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover saved the day inEastwood's biopic ""J. Edgar"" (2011) starring Leonardo DiCaprio, andEastwood portrayed an individual toiling under significant pressure todefend the United States against the scourge of Communism. Similarly,in 2014's ""American Sniper,"" Eastwood presented heroic Navy S.E.A.L.Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) as he put everything on the line to keep asmany of his fellow soldiers alive with his superb marksmanship skills.In Eastwood's 35th film as a director, the two-time Oscar-winninghelmer pays tribute to Sullenberger as a professional who felt that hewas only doing his job. As the eponymous hero, Tom Hanks makes asympathetic but effective protagonist, much as he did in the earlier2013 seafaring hostage thriller ""Captain Phillips."" Mind you, thenotion of suspense is a foregone conclusion. Everybody knows Sully wasa genuine hero who executed one of the most incredible forced waterlandings of a commercial passenger aircraft in history when he glidedUS Airways Flight 1549 into the chilly waters of New York City's HudsonRiver in 2009 without a single fatality. Not only did Sully perform anact of unparalleled bravery, but also the first responders displayedcomparable gallantry in rescuing Sully, his crew, and his passengers.Nevertheless, beneath the surface of his icy demeanor, Tom Hanks neverlets us forget that Sully was made of flesh & blood, was racked bydoubts and fears, and principally about what might have happened had henot followed his instincts and experience.Despite the fact that we know Captain Sullenberger survived the riverlanding in real life, director Clint Eastwood opens ""Sully"" with anaudacious scene. Sully's aircraft crashes into Manhattan, and fireballexplosions galore erupt with horrific consequences. Sully (Tom Hanks of""Forrest Gump"") awakens from this nightmare in a Big Apple motel.Throughout the rest of the film, he ponders what else that he couldhave done, and later has another nightmare wherein Katie Couric callshim a ""fraud"" on network television. As Eastwood's account of theincident shows, trouble struck US Airways Flight 1549 on its New Yorkto Charlotte, North Carolina flight, about three minutes after theaircraft had lifted off from La Guardia. A flock of Canadian geesecrossed the flight path of the Airbus A320 as it was ascending to 3000feet, collided with its two powerful GE turbofan engines, and werechurned in an aviary slush. If you read Sullenberger's autobiography""Miracle on the Hudson,"" he describes the birds as ""slurry"" after theengines ground them up, and the smell of charred fowls filtered intothe cabin. The aircraft lost both engines and neither could be broughtback into service. The veteran pilot ""eyeballed"" his options anddecided to ditch in the drink. ""Brace for impact,"" Sully warned hiscrew and passengers about a minute and a half before he glided the70-ton jet into Hudson. Miraculously, the plane neither blew up norsank. Sully, his First Office Jake Skiles (Aaron Eckhart of ""The DarkKnight""), and their three flight attendants evacuated the aircraftbefore water rose above the seats in the single-aisle cabin. Firstresponders and scuba cops appeared on the scene, and everybody wasbundled in jackets and carried to either side of the Hudson. One mildsubplot involves a family of three grown-ups who are separated duringthe multi-vessel rescue operation. Ironically enough, these three hadscrambled to get aboard Flight 1549 before it took off. Meanwhile,Sully was desperate to know if all passengers had been accounted for.Eventually, after a hospital check-up later during the day, he receivedconfirmation that everybody had been located. ""Perfect Stranger""scenarist Todd Komarnicki's screenplay divides the incident into threestories: Sully and his encounters with an adversial NationalTransportation Safety Board (NTSB), several telephone conversationswith his anxious wife Lorraine (Laura Linney of ""Mr. Holmes""), and theactual incident in the Hudson itself. One amusing episode has arestless Sully jog from his motel to a Manhattan bar for a drink. Pete,the bartender (Michael Rapaport of ""True Romance""), brags about theirnew alcoholic concoction named the Sully. According to Pete, thelibation consists of Grey Goose vodka and a splash of water. Meantime,each time that Sully and Jeff deal with the NTSB, the board iscontentiously brusque, and Sully worries about his career, largelybecause he wants to see the flight simulations of the incident.Basically, the NTSB emerges as the villains until fade-out.Suffice to say, ""Sully"" is about as succinct as a mainstream Hollywoodfilm can be. Eastwood has delivered one of the more focused films ofhis 45-year career clocking in at 96 trim minutes. Despite its austerebrevity, you will never feel like you have been slighted. You get toexperience the forced water landing at least twice along with someother exciting aerial shenanigans. Aside from another show-stopper of aperformance by Hanks, Eastwood has surrounded him with a first-classcast, right down to minor roles. Jamey Sheridan, Mike O'Malley, andAnna Gunn comprise the NTSB panel, and they make classic villains.Recently, the actual NTSB has complained that they weren't anywhere asdastardly has Eastwood and company have portrayed them. Nevertheless,good, solid, dramatic films require the presence of a villain, and theyfit the bill adequately because our hero has to answer to them. Thewater landing looks about as real as you might imagine it, and Eastwoodshows it from the perspective of several observers who happened to spotthe plane as it went down. However, don't go to ""Sully"" searching formelodramatic heroics like the John Wayne classic ""The High and theMighty"" (1954) because you will walk out definitely disappointed.""Sully"" celebrates not only an American, but it also celebratesAmerican character in general, and Eastwood's epic may rank as the bestfeel-good picture to illuminate screens in a long time."""
7,"""The movie was great with great star cast as we know its tom hanks nointroductions there and we know what a great director Clint Eastwoodis,but if you want the real experience of what exactly has happened onthat day i would say watch the documentary,i have seen many air crashinvestigations but this documentary stands out,its more real andintense and they have shown all that in 45 minutes..the way the pilotsof that aircraft narrated the whole incident step by step was reallyintense..we could see through their eyes what they would have gonethrough on that day and what precautions they had to take in such shorttime was amazing.."""
7,"""Basically, I'm skeptical of such films. Filming of actual events, likeSully is about. The film is about Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot whomanaged to land a plane in the Hudson River. But I gave it a shot. Thisis a low-key film, and the events are not made in chronological order.But this actually makes the film work better than expected. ClintEastwood uses good actors like Tom Hanks, to tell the story fromdifferent angles. Tom Hanks manages to give Hero Sully depth andinsight on several levels. Including how it is to suddenly come intofocus for the whole world. I thought the film was a little unexcitingthe first half hour, but Eastwood manages to tell this storythoroughly. And the film picked up and I was engaged by it. Do notexpect great action scenes, the film the film is actually a good dramaabout a man and his great accomplishment."""
8,"""Once more Clint Eastwood turns his lens on a unique American whoseactions put him in a category of one. Like American Sniper'sprotagonist Chris Kyle, Sully's Chesley Sullenberger has steely nervesthat enable him to make accurate decisions. This time the accoladeswon't be tied to controversy...or will they? In the early going we see the aftermath that ensued for Sullenberger asEastwood chooses to segue ahead of the ""miracle"" forced landing. TomHanks, as Captain Sullenberger, ably portrays a man who believes inhimself even as he is suffering from the trauma of an unbelievablyrisky nigh perfect water landing. The fact that he saved all 155 soulsaboard may be the only thing that really matters to a man likeSullenberger, but he's a family man with a career to also protect.Still, Sully knows that even as he saved lives his own professional onewill shortly be on the line. Honestly I did not realize how there wereforces playing that would have liked to vilify such a, seemingly great,life saving captain. I get it now, as Eastwood has woven this otherdarker plot immediately into the otherwise upbeat story. By introducingthis the way Eastwood has I realize that this is just as big as theactual landing. It's pretty clear that many factions stand to gainsomething by hanging fault on Sullenberger. Really? What's wrong withpeople. Here were have a horrendous disaster averted and someone isworrying about if the plane could have been saved along with thepassengers? I guess that's life in the litigation lane?After this excellent setup the movie segues back to the the flightitself. For many of us this is what we've wanted to experience and it'spretty good even if the sheer terror of the passengers is not aspalpable as I expected. The focus on the cockpit management is intenseand revealing. You'll see shortly why Sully's decision was the onlypossible way an actual ""human"" could have managed the situation for afavorable outcome. The writers and Eastwood did an exceptional job hereof recreating the hearing where things could have easily went against alesser man than Chesley Sullenberger. If not for him it's likely all onboard would have perished and if not for his sheer determination toprove the experts wrong he would have been hung out to dry living ashameful existence. You'll see why 38-secons a computer can'tunderstand, but a human actually must have (this is the minimum theboard allowed and its actually shy of the real decision time of almost1 and a half minutes) 's the hinge on which everything turns. This is abrilliantly revealed error in the flight simulation of the plane:multiple failures only a seasoned pilot can manage to which thecomputerized simulator can't accurately process.I think this is a great look at the only successful (i.e. everyone onboard lived) forced water landing of a wide body passenger jet. I thinkthis kind of stuff is not easy to blend the humanity and the coldanalytics together into a homogeneous whole. Clint Eastwood has managedthis and it's possible he'll get a nod for the best director AcademyAward even as these kind of stories seldom do. Tom Hanks, well, he'shis usual amazing chameleon self. He eschews all Hollywood bombast andany kind of over-acting. He plays it close and tight to a man who is avery serious type with the skills to match. He is, for an hour and ahalf, Chesley Sullenberger, not Tom Hanks. That's a high compliment andit's easy to miss as he inhabits the character without interjecting anyHank-isms. He probably won't get the nomination for best actor simplybecause he is so controlled, like an exceptionally intuitive anddisciplined man...like Captian Chesley Sullenberger.See the film and then see it again to soak in more of the gravity ofwhat actually happened. It was called ""The Miracle On The Hudson"" towhich this movie makes it clear that wasn't any news writer;shyperbole. Just an amazing man who under the worst circumstance madethe best outcome happen. I think this movie this point made well, plusit's truly uplifting."""
9,"""'SULLY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biopic based on the story of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger; the pilotsCaptain who heroically landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the HudsonRiver (in January of 2009), and saved all 155 people on board. Themovie stars Tom Hanks, as Captain Sully, and it costars Aaron Eckhart,Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Mike O'Malley and Jamey Sheridan. It wasdirected by Clint Eastwood, marking his 35th theatrical film as adirector, and it was written by Todd Komarnicki. The script is based onthe 2009 memoir 'Highest Duty' (written by Sullenberger and JeffreyZaslow). The movie's received mostly positive reviews from critics, andit's also a hit at the Box Office. I found it to be very intense, andinvolving!On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 hit a flock ofCanada geese (shortly after departing LaGuardia airport), whichdisabled both it's engines. With no airports in safe landing distance,Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Hanks), and First Officer JefferySkiles (Eckhart), were forced to land the plane on the Hudson River.All 155 passengers on board (miraculously) survived the emergency waterlanding. The media and public praised the pilots as heroes; but theNational Transportation Safety Board was beginning an investigationwhich could discredit the men, and possibly destroy Sully's career. I knew nothing about the investigation into pilot negligence, by theNTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), so this movie was veryinteresting to me. I also enjoyed seeing the epic events of the'Miracle on the Hudson', recreated for the big screen (they'reintense). The film is very inspiring, and involving. I love seeing astory where the little guy takes on the establishment too; in thisinstance it was definitely self defense, but it's still incrediblymoving! Eastwood is great at directing this type of movie, and Iactually think it's one of his better films. Hanks is also spectacularin the lead. It's a well made crowd-pleaser, that's for sure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFMQ3xbt9g"""
8,"""Sully is a film about a plane crash in New York (not 9/11)The events of 'The Miracle on the Hudson' occurred about 7 years ago,which is fairly recent (as far as major plane crashes go). This meansthat, while it was a bit of time ago, almost the entire target audienceof the film has some sort of memory of what occurred, considering itwas news that spread very quickly across the entire world.Immediately this puts Sully in a bit of a tricky situation. In order tomake a good story, there needs to be conflict, but if the events arechanged too much, then the audience will be able to tell, which thenbreaks immersion  something a director wants to avoid at all costs(unless you're shooting Deadpool of course). A film like Saving PrivateRyan can take creative liberties with it's story and still seem asthough it's based in WW2, but Sully can't do such a thing because thenit would just be a film about a plane crash, not specifically the onethat occurred in 2009. So the film needs to strike a very fine balancebetween the accurate depiction of events and an intriguing story between documentary and drama.Sully gets the first part right, with a very accurate recreation of thecrash. Almost all the details are covered excellently, from theconversations with the flight control tower to how many times the crewwent through the aircraft to look for remaining passengers. It alsohelps that the film was based off of the Chesley Sullenberger's book""The Highest Duty"". Even the sound design is remarkably accurate andespecially aircraft sounds which are generally very difficult to recordfaithfully, and the decision to keep music to a minimum means that theevents shown feel raw and unprocessed, as though it was filmed duringthe actual crash. All this really helps with the immersion during thecrash sequences. There was one noticeably oversight though, in one ofthe shots a poster for The Revenant is visible which is a bitdistracting considering The Revenant was released in 2015 and the filmis set in 2009. So it's a real shame that despite the efforts that Eastwood made tokeep sequences realistic and true to the actual event, the VFX reallylets it down. In a few shots it is perfectly fine, and seems completelybelievable, but there are more than a few shots where it looks likesomething out of Air Crash Investigations rather than actual footage ofa plane in the sky. Most of this is likely caused by a somewhatinaccurate simulation of the slightly different Raleigh scatteringpresent in New York skies, which means that the CGI planes look a bittoo shiny and clean  more like a toy model than a real aircraft.Visually, Sully has fairly decent cinematography. The use of IMAXcameras for many sequences adds a subtle intensity to the film thatwouldn't normally be present on smaller formats. There are a fewquestionable shot choices, but overall it complements the way the filmwas edited and also the restrained use of music. Something that reallystood out (in a good way) was the way the crash scene was filmed. Notusing a Bourne style camera movement in the (relatively) high intensityscene visibly helps strengthen the captain's point of view (which Iwon't say, cause spoilers).Now the second, and arguably more important, part is the story and howit was handled. The main problem with it in Sully is that the writerswere tasked to create conflict even when there wasn't really muchconflict in the first place. It is after all a film about a plane crashand part of the investigation following, there isn't really much of acomplication in the story. And the inability to take some creativefreedoms in the writing meant that even the little conflict they triedto produce didn't have any tangible stakes  if the 'bad guys' wonthere wouldn't be much problems for the pilots. Still, the film wasedited well enough that there was a coherent flow from each scene tothe next, and the choice of editing in a non-linear style meant thatthe film didn't become too predictable or that information wasn't tooeasy to find. Despite the film inherently having a weak story, Sullymanages to make itself interesting in more than a few ways.Another thing of note is the wonderful acting in the film. Tom Hanksreally shows why he is a first-rate actor, giving a completelybelievable performance as the captain of the flight. Aaron Eckhart alsomanages to bring to life his character of a younger co-pilot and thetwo main characters balance each other out wonderfully, giving life tothe film. Surprisingly, the extras also seemed to be quite capable.While it was nothing compared to Hank's work, they were good enough intheir (small) roles that it wasn't a distracting element.Overall I think Clint Eastwood made the right compromises and managedto balance the accuracy of the event and the narrative of the film  ifit was more 'factual' it would have been a dramatized documentary, ifit had a stronger story the film would have been less accurate and thatwould have been quite distracting. Maybe in a few decades if the filmwas to be remade there could be some more liberties taken with thestory, but given the circumstances, Sully is a wonderful, very naturalfeeling re-enactment of 'The miracle on the Hudson'.8.2/10"""
8,"""The story of Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's ""forced waterlanding"" of US Airways flight 1549 is delivered wonderfully to thecinema by Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks, portraying Sully as a subtleeveryday hero.The film follows the story of the crash of the Airbus A320 onto theHudson on January 15th 2009 and the following investigation by theNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Tom Hanks stars as Capt.Sullenberger, with Aaron Eckhart (First Officer Jeff Skiles), LauraLinney (Lorrie Sullenberger), Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany,Jamey Sheridan and Jerry Ferrara in supporting roles.But the undeniable star of this film is Hanks, who portrays Sully insuch a wonderful and inspiring way. Hanks gives a master class on howto portray an everyday man who suddenly becomes a national hero. Hanksportrays Sully as a subtle man, who is just trying to save the peopleon board his plane during the crash, while trying to save his job inthe aftermath. Hanks makes it believable to the viewer that he istraumatized by what has just transpired and it gets you to feel forSully, wanting to reach out and give him a hug. To put it in simplewords Hanks provides a professional tribute to a man that was all aboutprofessionalism. Hanks is wonderful as Capt. Sullenberger Hanks performance does alsohave a negative side. From the get go of the investigations, Sully isportrayed to be right at every opportunity with him attacking the NTSB,which he has every right to but, This comes back to the way in whichthe film is directed. The director of Sully is acclaimed director ClintEastwood and he has shaped the story to make it feel like that the NTSBare the bad guys for thinking of dishonoring an American hero such asCapt. Sullenberger, where they were merely just trying to do there jobsand found out as much information as they could about the incident.They are portrayed at the beginning as attackers of Sullenberger,asking questions about drug consumption, how much sleep he had orwhether there were any problems at home. I feel like this scene couldhave been done more subtly and not seem so attacking, thereforechanging the viewers perception of the NTSB from attackers to justpeople inquiring about the incident and doing their jobs.Apart from this Eastwood has shaped an insightful movie, taking us intothe deeper parts of the story and into the mind of Sullenberger. Hankswas in close contact with Capt. Sullenberger throughout filming,gaining insight from him and shaping the movie to be as truthful aspossible, which is evident through Hanks acting and how Eastwood hasstructured the film. The plane crash feels realistic and like we areapart of them and it fits right into the narrative and allows for acontinuous flow through the story. While the inquiry stages of the filmdon't feel boring but naturally flow from action to talking seamlessly.The films narrative is based on Sullenberger's autobiography ""HighestDuty"", which was co-written with Jeffrey Zaslow. The influences of thebook are seen throughout the film as we are shown cutaway shots ofplanes crashing into New York and of a military jet landing, whichenhance Hank's and Eastwood's portrayal of the traumatized Capt.Sullenberger post crash. While the insights from Sullenberger enablethe crash screens to be replicated for our eyes on screen. Sully is wonderfully crafted and wonderfully delivered across the park.Apart from the slight attack on the NTSB it runs smoothly through itsaction sequences and is intense throughout. Sully is an insightfulthriller that will have you leaving feeling better getting into a planethen other plane crash movies."""
NA,"""That is one word I can think of to describe the direction of ClintEastwood and performance of Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart (yes, don'tforget him, as the co-pilot Jeff Skiles). Laura Linney's talent is,unfortunately, all but wasted, playing Captain Chesley ""Sully""Sullenberger's wife. Still, with dialogue limited only to talking toher husband on the phone, Linney brings to the screen a presence fewothers can.The story of the landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson Riveron January 15, 2009 is definitely worth telling. If miracles exist,this is certainly one, with all 155 people on board the airbussurviving, including babies and the elderly. The fact that this happensin the deep of frigid winter makes it even more of a miracle. Theclosing line in the movie serves well to underline this. In theconclusion of the investigative hearing, when asked if he were to dothis again, is there anything he would want differently, Skilessprinkles his last words with a good sense of humor, ""Yes, I would doit in July"".But how to tell such a story when everything that is essential happenedin 208 seconds, i.e. a little over three minutes? This is the timebetween a sudden, totally unexpected encounter with a bunch of birdsthat instantly kills both of the engines (and some birds, no doubt),various restoration attempts in the cockpit failing to work, weightingthe choice between going back to LaGuardia or going to a neighboringairport in New Jersey and finally coming up with the decision thatneither is feasible and the Hudson River is the only real option. Allthese happening in 208 seconds. What can a director do? Repeatedly showwhat happened during these 208 seconds? Well, if the director is ClintEastwood, he can do a lot more.The narrative of this 96-minute movie is anchored on an investigationwhich just might turn the hero into a culprit. I am not sure how muchdramatization has been employed, but there does not appear to be much.While the public generally hails this as a miracle, there is afundamental question of whether Sully made the right decision.Specifically, despite the lucky turn of events, would either, or both,of the airports offer a better chance of survival? The whole thinghinges on computer simulated recreation in a cockpit with real pilotsattempting these landings. In both cases the result is affirmative.There now seems to be a case for reprimanding the two pilots forputting the lives of their passenger at unnecessary risk, even whendisaster was averted.Here was the dramatic tension. Eastwood deftly assembles a collectionof scenes in a way that provides variety but not generate confusion.Most interesting is how what happened in those 208 minutes is handled.In the opening scene, we see it ending with the plane crashing intodensely populated Manhattan, and Sully waking up with cold sweat on hisforehead. We get to see the real thing only at the very end, in thepublic enquiry where Sully successfully refutes the computerassimilations. Only then that, for the first time, everybody (theinvestigating committee, attending reporters, as well as Sully andSkiles) hear the live recordings from the cockpit in those 208 minutes.While everybody listens to this on earphones, we the audience are privyto visuals from inside the cockpit, the long-expected nail-bitingmoments solidly delivered.There are no villains, despite the initial apparent hostility of theinvestigative committee. From the onset, Sully tries to convince Skilesthat these people are not out to get them personally, but just doingtheir job. It was quite heart-warming to see, at the end, how theyrespond to Sully's convincing refuting of the cockpit assimilation""evidence"", portrayed in subtle facial expressions when they finallyacknowledge the credit to which the pilots are due. Also a solid job,by the movie makers in recognizing this aviation miracle by Sully, whogenerously shares the credit with everyone involved in the rescue onthe Hudson River in the middle of winder."""
9,"""Well, Sally is one of those movies where you can just tell from thecast and director that it's going to be a heck of a movie! You justknow.. I was reluctant myself to go to the movies and watch it cause itseemed more of a pay-per-view film to watch at home. It's not.It's masterfully made, keeps the sense of suspense high and althoughthe movie is not revolving around the specific time that the accidenttook place, but goes beyond that point in time, it's still amazing. Iloved all the flashbacks and leaps in time. Tom Hanks seems to be raising the bar over and over again and it won'tbe a surprise to see him get an Oscar for this. He depicted adetermined, professional but deeply human pilot that managed to do whatno one thought could be done. This movie is all about surpassing human limits and living up andbeyond expectations. It's a movie about the real world and a real movieat the same time. It's a high-quality, high-fidelity and high- standardone. It's the best movie I've seen so far within 2016."""
9,"""How do you make an intense and entertaining movie when you already knowjust how it is going to end? Trust Clint Eastwood to do just that.In fact, this is more than just an ordinary plane crash film. Itintelligently explores the human elements of the story and thecomplexities of human emotions. We all know what happened. In January 2009, our hero pilot Chesley'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), along with co-pilot Jeff Skiles(Aaron Eckhart) made a miraculous emergency water-landing on the HudsonRiver, saving all passengers and crew on-board. This feat wasunprecedented and Sully was hailed as a hero by people all around theworld. The film avoids a one-dimensional characterization of Sully and insteadportrays him as just a normal family guy trying to his job. It showsthat experiencing such a trauma has its darker consequences, despiteits seemingly happy ending. When it comes to characters battling tough situations and internalstruggles, I can't think of anyone else more fitting than Tom Hanks toplay them. He doesn't just play them, he transforms into them. He wastremendous as Sully, a man who exudes a raw, quiet resilience, and evenwithout saying a word, you can sense and feel his pain and unrest. Hisperformance is a perfect blend of Sully's audacity and vulnerabilities. To create conflict and tension, the film needs a villain. In this one,it is the aviation authorities (NTSB). There is bound to be somedisagreement there, but it does effectively provide the story withobstacles Sully needs to defeat. We are sympathetic towards Sully  Hanks is just naturally humble andamiable. We want him to win. He finally admits at the end of the filmthat he is proud of what he has done. And he should be."""
1,"""Of course, I knew of The Miracle on the Hudson and of it's hero, Sully,but not of the subsequent half-baked governmental finger-pointing thismovie so skillfully portrays.Because the investigation was conducted-in/released-to the public, Iassume the climatic scene toward the end of the movie - in which Sullyhimself a crash investigator, publicly exposes the flaw in the board'sanalysis which wrongly faulted him with an error in judgment - wasaccurately portrayed. If it was, Sully's calm restraint and eloquencein his own defense has earned even more of my respect and admirationfor him.Other personal aspects of the miraculous event are explored andportrayed in a well-balanced non-sappy manner: the immediate mediacrush on Sully and his family that resulted; his instant popularity;the mental trauma that resulted in it's aftermath; the importance ofhaving a good co-pilot and crew; the steady, modest and grounded manorof our hero; and of course, the gratitude of the survivors.A jazz pianist himself, the understated Eastwood-composed musical scoreadded just the right mood at the right times; and the gifted Hanksagain showed us why he earns these types of important and iconic roles.It's rare for a film to inform, entertain, and inspire or uplift all atthe same time; but the fine screenplay, acting, and directorial choicesof this one - not the least of which is the as-the-credits-roll briefappearance of real-life Sully and some of the actual water-landing (notcrash!) survivors all reunited along side the actual plane (now in amuseum) - landed them all!"""
9,"""He had done it before and he had done it a few more times afterthat.And every time he made it a point to not miss the target . Takingthe apprehension out of the head of the viewer,laying it down nice neasy, stripping it to its purest form and then delivering the finaldose with dexterity; Clint Eastwood has done it once again. The abilityto lift a viewer's soul from the seat and placing it in the storydelivering an out of body experience is the skill very fewpossess.Considering Mr.Eastwood's interest and success,particularly oflate, in making movies based on true events, Sully was looked forwardto pretty anticipatedly in the erudite factions of the fraternity andaudience.So when you have such agenda on your hands and stakes arehigh, obviously, you need the perfect tools to realize the vision.First, Tom Hanks. One of the very few actors who not only understandtheir role but also are able to share the vision of the director in themovie making process (I guess that's what makes him a very successfulproducer as well). Speaking a bit about Tom. Over the course of hiscareer, he has taken me, like the countless others, on a roller coasterride of the modern cinema and has added many dimensions to moviewatching. For me, he has given the confidence to let go of fear, doubt,and disbelief regarding whether the actors are doing justice to whatexactly director had in mind, whenever he's on screen.Now, about the movie. It paces nicely giving out the necessaryrealistic vibes. Hanks, in all senses literal and figurative, is thecaptain here.He handles the build-up and unraveling of a small butwell-rounded web perfectly.I see no one else than Tom playing theaudacious Ct. Chesley Sullenberger. Now since it's all happened andwrote upon it's not a spoiler to say that it's about a 'plane landingin the river'. In the process of achieving a singular class in themaking, the crux of this event is shown in three differentperspectives, each going on and adding the much-required dimension tothe viewer's understanding of the scenario. You just have to experiencethe joy of putting those perspectives together to form the whole of theevent. Also, in an excellent display of 'shot- making', Eastwood,builds the protagonist's drama of the story with a forehand and pointsout potholes in the judiciary system in a cautious backhand.And allthis fitted cozily in 95 minutes of running time, is a hats-off effortfrom the team. Take a bow. Also, Aaron Eckhart is worth mentioninghere, as he plays perfect Watson to Hank's Holmes. Rest of the castdoes just about enough not to get noticed for any wrong reasons,Barring Anna Gunn. To whom, by the way, you have already given a fairshare of loathing in Breaking Bad (:P) and you won't be seen makingfriends with her here either.I was wondering, before, that why the movie was being made in IMAX,since it did not have the blockbuster visual element to it , only tolearn that there's that one little step taken,very much necessary todepict a plummeting A320 from a spectacular New-York skyline in thebackdrop to the fluvial water body of the Hudson. It does take you fromeliciting awe to dropping jaw. It's worth it. Good call Blondie. Andsince on the topic, a worthy mention here for cinematographer TomStern,Who's been Clint's sidekick in the camera department in many ofhis previous directorial ventures, for crafting some IMAX worthysequences and putting the peripheral vision of the viewer to a gooduse.Since Interstellar broke the stereotypes of background scores by usingit generously, audaciously, and successfully, I make it a point to takenotice the use (over/under) of background score in a film. No follieshere as well, as Sully is punctuated with background score only whennecessary, giving enough scope for the viewer to let the reality of theevents unfolding on screen, sink in..Deep.The body-binding spell cast by the powerful duo of cinematic wizardswill take quite some time to wear off. In all regards of film- making,justice is served. Bon appetit."""
2,"""Let me start off by saying that the crash and rescue scenes are verytouching, the use of music very effective. But I could not help but think during the whole movie ""Why do I care ifhe made a mistake or not?"". The trailer pretty much gives youeverything you will find out about the character Sully - there islittle character development, I see no reason to sympathise with him,nor was I given any reason to understand what ""struggle"" he was goingthrough - the phone conversations with his wife seem like anafterthought - we don't know what exactly are their family issues. Thewife mentions losing a house - but there is no context. The daughtersare never present on camera - why is Sully away from home and seem tohave a strained/detached relationship with his family? Almost scenealmost feels like they are created for a sake of it. Why the hotelscene when the only thing they do there is to say they're tired andthen go out? For the large investigation committee present on screen, only twopeople have a voice. And their animosity towards the pilots are verycontrived - only one reason was revealed in the causal chat between thetwo pilots ""insurance"". And after Sully raised the point about humanreaction time - there is this sudden magical change in attitude of thetwo people - so drastic that the women who wanted to add asentimentalist personal note to the pilots.Everything just feels so contrived, artificial - emotions just don'tadd up or make sense. The context is not clear. Given that we all knowthat no one dies in the incident, the movie failed to make me want tocare about Sully and his reputation, given how little I know about him.If you're an American, I see the appeal of the crash and rescue scene,but other than that I don't see why this movie deserves the acclaim itreceived."""
1,"""Chesley ""sully"" sullenberger is a hero and if your going to make a filmabout how sully and his team saved 155 souls on board us airways flight1549 that landed in the hudson river there is 2 simple rules.1. Correct cast 2. Correct story.Well clint Eastwood you deserve to be knighted as you got both spot on,tom hanks as sully is breathtaking and i guarantee his performance willwin a Oscar award (i said that about dicaprio in the revenant and wasright) Aaron eckhart as jeff skiles sully's co-pilot portrays the roleperfectly and how the 2 men done the impossible and land a damaged birdand then go on to fight for the truth about the incident against theNTSB.the way clint Eastwood directed this film is done by emphasise on whatactually happened and not just certain characters and is eastwoods bestfilm ever with every scene every little detail is just mesmerising.sully is quite possibly the best true story film ever made"""
1,"""Sully is a biopic about, pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger(Tom Hanks).Sully & his First Officer Jeff Skiles(Aaron Eckhart) have no choicebut, to land US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson river. This is due toa dual engine failure. Despite all of this, Captain Sully & FirstOfficer Skiles saved the lives of all 155 passengers on-board theaircraft. This is due to Sully's last-minute unorthodox decision, toland the aircraft on the Hudson river. However, the aviationauthorities question his decision. Sully is a sensational film. Clint Eastwood has directed yet anothermasterpiece, after American Sniper(2014). The most fascinating aspectof this movie is that, it is based on a true story. The visual effectsdepartment has flawlessly depicted, how Captain Sully & First OfficerSkiles made a successful emergency landing on the Hudson river. Thefact that they shot several scenes at the actual locations, definitelysolidifies the authenticity of the film. The background score byChristian Jacob & Tierney Sutton Band is subtle yet memorable. Theperformances are the highlight of the film. Tom Hanks steals the showas Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger. Hanks portrays Sully's subtle changein emotions throughout the movie, effortlessly. Aaron Eckhart isfantastic as Jeff Skiles. Eckhart adds a little bit of much needed witto the film. Laura Linney is spectacular as Lorraine Sullenberger. MikeO'Malley, Jamey Sheridan & Anna Gunn are great as Charles Porter, BenEdwards & Elizabeth Davis, respectively. The actors that played thepassengers & crew of Flight 1539, are brilliant as well. Sully is afeel-good film. Go for it, immediately!"""
8,"""Today I saw Sully and it was such a great movie. The intensity of theplane crash in the Hudson and Captain Sully's story was veryinteresting. Clint Eastwood did a great job directing and the cast weregood at portraying the roles. Yet, I did notice an editing issue. Inthe scene where Captain Sully is running through Times Square, hepasses by a poster that shows the Broadway show, ""Aladdin"", directed byCasey Nicholaw, which came out in 2014. The movie takes place inJanuary of 2009. Tom Hanks did a very good job and was on point withhis character. I also find it interesting how in the movie, actualpeople who were in the crash were in the movie. Overall, I woulddefinitely recommend the movie to people who are into biographies /documentaries."""
1,"""Go see this movie!!I don't normally write reviews. But in this case, I feel like I should.I am not a Tom Hanks fan. I mean, he is a good actor, but I find abunch of his movies a bit dull. On the other hand, I absolutely loveClint Eastwood. As an actor, and as well, as a director. This teamis...the dream team. I absolutely loved Hanks performance, I think thatmakes the difference between this movie and similar ones. I saw a lotof movies with plane crashes or plane-situations. I recall very wellthe sensations each one of them left upon me: ""Flight"", ""Red Eye"", ""Non-Stop"" and even ""Final Destination"". All of these movies made meforget the plot right after leaving the cinema. In this case, you willfeel empathy. You will live with Hanks's character all the uncertainty.And I absolutely loved the quotes in this movie. And the lastline...was the climax. Go see it!"""
8,"""Many people remember, or have at least heard of, the ""Miracle on theHudson"", the 2009 landing of a disabled passenger jet on the HudsonRiver by Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, resulting in thesurvival of all of the plane's passengers and crew. But how much do wereally know about the incident? In most cases, probably not much morethan what was in that first sentence. That's what makes the story sucha great idea for a movie. With Todd Komarnicki's adaptation ofSullenburger's 2009 memoir ""Highest Duty"" as their guide, directorClint Eastwood and star Tom Hanks bring us the behind-the-scenes storyof this incredible water landing and its aftermath in the drama ""Sully""(PG-13, 1:35).The film opens with a plane crash scene. It's a literal nightmare ofCaptain Sullenberger (Hanks), who is haunted by his experience oflanding his airliner on the Hudson River  and what might have happenedif things had gone differently. Different scenarios play out in Sully'shead as he sleeps  and also while he's awake, forced to relive theincident by NTSB investigators. Their questions and the facts about the""crash"" (as they call it, ""forced water landing"", as Sully calls it)lead Sully to second-guess himself and his actions, even as he is beinghailed in the media and in person as a hero and he is beingwholeheartedly supported by his wife, Lorraine Sullenberger (LauraLinney), via telephone from their California home.As the investigators (played by Mike O'Malley, Jamey Sheridan and AnnaGunn) repeatedly interview Sully and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (AaronEckhart), we hear information and arguments which will make most MovieFans question whether Sully made the right call and whether he reallyis a hero. As Sully alternately struggles with those same issues andreaffirms his version of events for the skeptical investigators, wealso see that short flight reenacted, from different perspectives andwith more and more of the story coming to light. We also get a taste ofthe media frenzy which surrounded Sully and his family, and seeflashback scenes of Sully's earlier experiences flying as a teenagerand in the military.The combination of the vast movie-making experience of Eastwood(directing his 35th feature) and Hanks (with over 30 years' worth offilms on his resume) has resulted in an interesting and well-conceivedtelling of Sully's experiences. Much like the NTSB investigation at thecenter of the story, the film uses what most of us didn't know aboutthe ""Miracle on the Hudson"" to dramatic effect, telling the untoldstory as if peeling back the layers of an onion. Besides a morecomplete picture of this incredible incident (and another reminder ofhow talented Eastwood and Hanks are), the film also gives us a subtlebut profound reminder that there is, and never will be, a substitutefor human experience, intuition and guts. ""Sully"" may not be athrill-a-minute movie, but it uses every one of its 95 minutes verywell. ""A-"""""
6,"""So here's the deal: in the English classes I teach, I like to bring upthe Rhetorical Triangle, which was originally by Aristotle or one ofthose Greek fellas, and what this consists of are three things in anydecent piece, fiction or otherwise that is meant to convince us of itsworth (obviously): Logos, Pathos and Ethos. Logos is the use of logic,facts, or truth; Pathos is the appeal to a reader or just an audience'semotions; Ethos is the speaker or writer's character, credibility, andauthority.I thought of this when I was walking out at the end of Sully, the newfilm by the 86 years old(ass) block of American grit known as ClintEastwood and starring Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart as the pilots wholanded the plane without any loss of life in the Hudson river inJanuary 2009. Surely the film has the logos and ethos down - it doesn'tfudge any facts (far as I or most can tell), and it's made by afilmmaker who has gone around the block already when it comes todepicting figures who may be called heroes but they simply (in thatHoward Hawks tradition) see themselves as professionals (think of thesoldiers from Flags of Our Fathers or American Sniper, the former madefor dull viewing, the latter more engaging but troubling at times). Butthe pathos? I'm not so sure.Sully was a man who was and remains beyond reproach: he *did* do hisjob and did it well, and despite the doubt that may be planted to theflight committee/board who are investigating the landing in the river(basically the closest this movie has to antagonists), where's theconflict? There may be some interior struggle I may have missed, but insuch a short run time I'm not so sure Eastwood and the screenwritersleave much room for any troubling character signs or things that canput this story in flux (especially as it's one that is relativelyrecent and more in the public eye than Chris Kyle even was bycomparison). This isn't to say that from that ethos/logos perspectivethe filmmakers and cast don't do their job - this may be one ofEastwood's better directed films in a while, and Hanks and Eckhart(mostly Hanks as it's his guy at the top of the bill) so as good asthey can in portraying these men.But, and it's not too small a but, what else is there to this story? Ifone thinks back to two of the intense films that involve plane crashesfrom the past ten years, United 93 and Flight, they each had a)something that was intensely significant that made it a story worthtelling and utilized pathos to the Nth degree, or b) gave us acharacter (Denzel in Flight) who was troubled and flawed and made it alittle more difficult to see the story as black and white. Sullydoesn't dance too far into the gray areas, and it's not really becauseEastwood or his filmmaking team avoided them. They're just not there tobegin with: a plane had a major problem, the pilots were bothprofessional *and* human in their duties (the one interesting factor tome is that), and then there was an investigation. Oh, and Sully's wifeor girlfriend (Laura Linney) had trouble selling their other propertyor something. Shrug.In other words, aside from the centerpiece of the film, where we seethe crash happen from the perspectives of the pilots, the passengers(including three who were separated due to arriving at the last momentto the gate), the attendants, the airline traffic controllers, thecoast guard, and which is an incredible piece of filmmaking andperformance unto itself, there is not too much 'there' thereemotionally speaking. That may be part of the point, that this was acase that showed the best in people and the fact that no one died wassomething of a miraculous event. Is that enough to make it worthrushing out immediately to plunk down the how many dollars it costs tosee it in a theater? I'm not totally convinced."""
8,"""Bottom line is this movie about good luck and heroism is a unique andrare true story that is worth watching and deserves a grand big screenportrayal. It shows everything you want to see about the water landingand rescue in painstaking detail. Tom Hanks is right for the role ofmodest hero. The production values are good and the content isinteresting. Liked the way he imagined the alternatives to the waterlanding and the way the flight and passengers were portrayed quiterealistically with middle aged stewardesses and cramped seats.The flaws in this movie are the structure and focus. Firstly thejumping back and forth in time breaks up the impact. Better if thestory had been told chronologically with maybe just one flashback. Theright way to do it would have been the whole flight and landing, thenthe investigation.Secondly the focus was more on the NTSB investigation which should havebeen maybe a 15 minute part of the movie. It was terrible that he hadto justify his actions and you feel righteous indignation at the NTSBinvestigators etc who questioned his judgement. The exoneration couldhave been faster. So it was right they had all this in the movie butthis aspect was dragged out and left a bitter aftertaste.Tom Hanks looks old here with his white hair and a little less leanthan the real person. But he does a restrained and effective job. AaronEckhart is a good co pilot. Anna Gunn is good at playing the hatefulcharacter - here the villains are the investigators.There aren't many happy endings in events like this so it's good it wasmade into a movie. Worth watching."""
6,"""It was an OK movie, with lots of natural acting. Hanks does the jobwell as usual, so does Eckhart too, but I just don't get it..isn'tsomething missing here? When I watched the actual story on TV news in2009 I just thought, wow .here's a real hero of our time who just didthe right thing at the right time at the right place. Definitely 155people were so lucky to have Sully as their captain I was full ofadmiration of what Captain Sully did in those 36 seconds.... But themovie simply fail to give us that feeling the wow factor! I justthought being a feature movie it could have added some dramatizedevents to enrich the characteristics of a live drama... a featuremovie. Especially involved with 155 people, Clint could have dug in totheir emotional side to enrich the sentimental side of a feature film.But it just looked like a semi documentary. Simply a great story wastedin vain."""
6,"""Was waiting for this Clint Eastwood movie for a year. Specially afterwatching the documentary on this incident. The documentary is mindblowing and some how it makes the questions on audience mind on owndeeds, whether we are doing right in life... the passengers who facedeath in front shows their emotional dialogues so sweet and hearttouching.. which surely makes the audience cry.. especially when one ofthe passenger said - ""after this incident i started to questioneverything in my life,..felt like whatever done yesterday was not theright "" life of each on the board touched with this incident and theysurely changed. Now let come to the movie. Unfortunately nothing of theemotional part of the passengers shown in the movie. Even when the filmmaker got a good chance to win some tears from the audience they didnot gone much for emotional part but concentrated on investigationpart. Film should have at least give concentration to the scenes of theincident but again unfortunately whole incident short cut to some fewshots and that too in discontinued flashbacks with no continuity orwhatsoever. However if you like more to watch in investigation view ofthe incident this will be enough and OK... director fully concentratedfor that portion only, and to be frank done a good job."""
4,"""I was all set to learn about the details behind the big Hudson Riversplash down so l went to see this film with great anticipation. What adisappointment!Almost half the film contains a drama that seems very contrived and forsome reason anti- NTSB. I'm not sure why the organization tasked toinvestigate ""all"" airline incidents is portrayed in such a sinisterlight. Were they not performing a routine investigation into anextraordinary event? Is Capt. Sully beyond reproach to the airlinepaying his handsome salary or the passengers to which their lives werein his hands? Give me a break.If it wasn't for that elephant in the room the movie would've been 45minutes long and a good adventure film with a real American ""hero"" ifthat label is necessary to sell tickets. But I'm not sure why thispicture was made with such a thin story trumped up with a veryquestionable amount of fluff to make it a full length feature.I hope an appropriate documentary can be made for television to tellthe real story of this incident but I wouldn't waste $12 to see thisfilm for what it's worth."""
NA,"""An intelligently unfolded drama that makes good use of multipleflashbacks and internal visions to bring the audience not only insideSully's head but also to really 'feel' the emergency landing ratherthan just witness it, without disturbing the flow of the film. TomHanks and Aaron Eckhart give solid performances and their portrayals ofpilot and co pilot respective are compelling and likable. Laura Linneyis good but doesn't have much of a part. After that it's just a handfulof featured passengers, who are a little predictable but notproblematically so, and the investigation team, who come across rightoff as having an agenda to scapegoat Sully - needed for drama,otherwise you don't really have a film - based on fact or not I can notsay. The big event is very well portrayed, and seen from multipleperspectives several times via flashbacks. CGI was occasionally alittle obvious but I watched on an IMAX screen, the largest in theworld, so possibly that exacerbated the issue. I don't recommend seeingit on the IMAX - too many close ups of cast which felt weird plus Iperceived a kind of jerkiness in movement at times as if frame rate wasoff for the giant screen - no idea what caused this or even quite howto describe it, but it was distracting. IMAX was great for the flightscenes and that's it. Good job Eastwood and co. 7.5."""
4,"""OK, since I don't get my information about the JFK assassination fromOliver Stone, why do I expect ""truth"" from a guy who talks to chairs?Without question the movie is a technical marvel, and I understand thatMike O'Malley has to put food on the table and do what the directortells him to do, but this movie's gratuitous and conspiratorial bashingof career civil servants is going to drive me to Sully's autobiographyand the NTSB transcripts. Did they really try to railroad guys who JUSTSAVED 155 PEOPLE? Did they really hide the number of (SPOILER ALERT)failed simulations just to get Sully's silver scalp? Seriously? Whatcould possibly be the government's motivation beyond (SPOILER ALERT)""big gubmint is evil""? And since Clint couldn't find a chair to playthe lead villain, he had to find the smarmiest, most supercilious actorpossible (again, sorry Mr. O'Malley.) Is this is actually what happenedthen my apologies, but I'll bet my talking chair that it's not. Somefictionalizations are harmless, and some, like ""Eyes in the Sky"" arereally on the money about how bureaucracts work, but are there reallyno honorable and honest people in NTSB? Anybody at NTSB want to offer areview?OK, after posting, I did indeed go to the web and read the extremelyinteresting and balanced NTSB accident report. Did I find the slightestcriticism of Sully? Noooooo. Did I find any indications of efforts toblame him? Noooooo. I am so sick and tired of the sloppy and easydefault of painting hard-working, conscientious people as villains justbecause they, gasp, are trying to keep the flying public safe bylooking into accidents. In the report, the real villains are eightpound geese and overly long and cumbersome checklists, but I guess thatain't dramatic enough for ol' Clint."""
NA,"""'I have been flying for over four decades and I am being judged for thelast 208 seconds' - It's a line (well not exactly, but something tothat effect, IMDb doesn't have the quotes section up yet) from themovie and it pretty much sums up Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger's'miracle' landing of US Airways flight 1549 on the Hudson on 15 January2009. Plot and ScriptSully, played by Tom Hanks makes a human decision relying on his vastexperience and lands a plane of 155 people on the Hudson, making it thefirst flights to survive a water landing with all lives intact. Themovie is about viewpoints - of the pilots (Aaron Eckhart plays the co-pilot), of the passengers, and of the investigating officers of thesafety board. It shows what happened during the flight, after it landedand the investigation where the pilots were scrutinized for theirdecision as the simulations said that they could have gone back toLaGuardia and landed.Considering it is a true incident and everybody survived, this film isdead serious and comes straight to the point. Simulations can predictscenarios to a certain extent but they don't and cant predict howhumans will react in a certain situation. How can one judge a person ina few seconds when they have a lifetime of experience with noincidents? That's the question the film tries to ask. Characterization and Acting (C&A)I have a soft corner for Tom Hanks - he just picks the right moviesmaybe, or he is just plain lucky, but he is great in every movie. Thiswas no exception. I hadn't read much about the actual incident, and Iam reading about it now and watching a few videos of the real Sully -Tom Hanks is so much like him. Calm, composed - he did what he doesbest, play a role and bring it to life. It was mainly his movie.As for Aaron Eckhart, this is the second time I have liked him in amovie (first was Batman of course with him as Dent) - he plays the partwell. There are other talented actors as well like Laura Linney butlike I said, it was completely a Tom Hanks movie.Sounds and Effects (S&E)The movie has a serious tone to it and rightly so. Not much music butthe sounds are great. There is a scene where the flight is just aboutto hit water and you can hear the air hostesses saying in unison 'Headsdown, stay down' and its just so real that you almost do it. Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)I really liked the look of the movie. It is difficult to do a flightmovie I think because most of the time it does look unreal, but I thinkSully looked quite real. Even the water landing looked like it was howit would have happened. Direction and Overall (D &O)You gotta give it to Clint Eastwood - he is all of 86 and still givingus great movies, hats off to him. His movies are about people and thiswas too. But at 96 minutes (one of his shortest movies), it still feltextremely stretched. And it was pretty uni-dimensional - it was Sully'sstory, the audience is not given any other vantage point. Having said that, the 204 seconds that Sully took to land the planewith no deaths is probably the best 96 minutes we have on screen. I wonder why they took so long to make the movie?So here are my scores according to my new system:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1.5Characterization and Acting (C&A)  1.5Sounds and Effects (S&E)  1.5Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)  1.5Direction and Overall (D &O)  1.5Overall Score  7.5 out of 10Watch it once to know about the 'Miracle on the Hudson' and one of thegreatest stories in aviation history.

7,"""The film recounts the US 1549 emergency landing on the Hudson River not in, as the First Officer Jefferey Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) cheekilypoints out  and the ensuing investigation. Sully's not so much aboutthe crash (though you get to see it in IMAX grandeur at least thrice);it is about the little-known details of the investigation launched intofinding out if Captain Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks in top form) couldhave done better. The filmis full of such delicious ironies. TheCaptain has saved 155 lives, but could he have saved them withoutdamage to the aircrafta fact that is of great interest to theinsurance company? Could he have avoided risking their lives in thefirst place? Captain Sully may have emerged triumphant against theCanadian geese, and the Hudson, but can his human frailties overcomethe cold computer simulations that seem to suggest that his choicewasn't the best under the circumstances? What about the irony of beingregarded as a national hero, even as an internal investigatiocch thenthreatens to countermine the achievements of a 40-year-old career? InSully's own words, ""I've flown millions during the 40 years of mycareer. But I'm going to be judged on 208 seconds."" Is Sully ""a hero ora fraud?""

I thought the movie was very well structured as itwent between present and past. The landing scenes were quite nervewracking and emotions ran high with all the survivors after they weresaved. Hanks shows us how tough this was for a low key man like Sully,having to endure the questioning and the huge responsibility of beingthe hero. I felt that though only a little more than 90 minutes, itstill had filler that it could have done without, such as Sully in hisyoung days. I know it showed his love of flying but just didn't seem toclick with me. Still, it's well worth seeing and another fine additionto Hanks and Eastwood's filmography."""
8,"""Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks throws the first punches in the 2016 Oscarbattle with this very good drama about hero pilot Chesley ""Sully""Sullenberger who successfully landed his US Airways plane in the Hudsonriver after both engines were taken out by birds.Professionally and economically directed by Eastwood, this film focuseson the NTSB investigation into the landing and could Sully have flownthe plane to a nearby airport?The answer is never really in doubt as we all know what happened andEastwood casts ""Mr. Trustworthy"" Tom Hanks in the title role, so whenthe NTSB questions Sully's instincts and decisions, Hanks/Sullyresponds that he KNEW he did the right thing, we - as the audience -never doubt him as well.This movie shows a director and an actor in lockstep with each otherand both showing that they ""still have it"". Let's start with Hanks (andthe other actors). The whole cast is excellent. Hanks, of course, takesus along for the ride and he says more with a look of determination anda squint of his eye than most actors can with a thousand words andgestures. His Sullenberg is a real human being, with doubts andtroubles, but strong and in command. Hanks is ably assisted by AaronEckhardt as co-pilot Jeff Skiles. To be honest, I find Eckhardt'sacting to be pedestrian - not bad, not great, pretty middle of the road- but he is as good as I have seen him in this role. I think it isbecause he has to elevate his game in riding side saddle to Hanks, andstep up he does. Laura Linney (as Sully's wife) and Holt McCallany (asSully and Skiles Union Rep) also give strong, solid performances. Onlythe trio of NTSB investigators - Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn and JamieSheridan - fair poorly, but I think that is because the script reallydraws them with heavy, villainous lines - lines that need to be drawnto give the film some dramatic tension - but lines that do turn thesethree into caricatures, not human beings.But that small quibble can be forgiven because of the solid,workmanlike direction of Eastwood. This movie is short, compact andsolid - nary a scene too long or extraneous word of dialogue in thefilm. Eastwood, wisely, knows that the tension in this film is NOTwhether or net Sully is cleared by the NTSB, but by the 208 seconds ofthe flight from the bird strike to landing and Eastwood films this sowell and so precisely that I was glued to my seat, even though I knewwhat happened and how it ended. For good measure, Eastwood goes throughthat 208 seconds a 2nd time and I was just as glued to my seat thattime as well!A strong effort from Eastwood and Hanks, one that you will enjoyviewing.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"""
8,"""Sully (2016): Dir: Clint Eastwood / Cast: Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart,Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Ann Cusack: Chesler ""Sully"" Sullenberger isnow famous for landing a plane in the Hudson after a flock of geesecollided the engines. He is seen as a hero to the 100 percent survivingpassengers yet placed under scrutiny by the powers that be who questionwhether he made the proper choice of action. He was a family man whowas devoted to flying but is not prepared for the media frenzy thatfollows. This brings the first time collaboration of director ClintEastwood and star Tom Hanks. Eastwood focuses on the frenzy and thereactions of both sides. One major drawback is the over the topreactions of those who view Sully as a hero. He is hugged, kissed,worshipped, and it is all pathetically corny. Hanks effectively bringsout the exhausted state of Sully's being as he becomes more unsure ofhimself. Aaron Eckhart plays his supportive co-pilot Jeff Skiles whofeels victimized by the whole investigation. Laura Linney plays Sully'swife whose daily routine wait for her husband becomes an event on thelocal news. Other characters are cardboard with some performances goinginto overacting. Eastwood has tackled true accounts before and herepresents an impressive vision of a plane landing in the Hudson throughflashbacks. Sully's integrity is questioned but those who was thereview him as a heroic man of action. Score: 8 ½ / 10 / Writing: 100% /Themes: 66% / Acting: 60% / Directing: 100% / Visual: 100%"""
7,"""A every day guy doing his job turns into a hero. Sounds like a FrankCapra movie not a Clint Eastwood movie. You'll know it's an Eastmanmovie by the limited note score.Tom Hanks gives a spot on performance and makes this movie work. If youare from another planet you may not know about the ""miracle on theHudson"". Mostly everyone else knows how this is going to come out.Basically 155 people survived the water landing or crash depending onyou perspective. If you liked the water landing or plane crashes youget to see it a few times. Even the over end credits are over theactual plane in the river. There is a end of credits segment that isvery effective with the actual passengers identifying their seatnumbers.In spite of very few surprises because you know the story it ispresented in a very watchable movie. It's looks good on the big screenand should be enjoyed in a theater environment. Head up stay up."""
8,"""Many people remember, or have at least heard of, the ""Miracle on theHudson"", the 2009 landing of a disabled passenger jet on the HudsonRiver by Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, resulting in thesurvival of all of the plane's passengers and crew. But how much do wereally know about the incident? In most cases, probably not much morethan what was in that first sentence. That's what makes the story sucha great idea for a movie. With Todd Komarnicki's adaptation ofSullenburger's 2009 memoir ""Highest Duty"" as their guide, directorClint Eastwood and star Tom Hanks bring us the behind-the-scenes storyof this incredible water landing and its aftermath in the drama ""Sully""(PG-13, 1:35).The film opens with a plane crash scene. It's a literal nightmare ofCaptain Sullenberger (Hanks), who is haunted by his experience oflanding his airliner on the Hudson River  and what might have happenedif things had gone differently. Different scenarios play out in Sully'shead as he sleeps  and also while he's awake, forced to relive theincident by NTSB investigators. Their questions and the facts about the""crash"" (as they call it, ""forced water landing"", as Sully calls it)lead Sully to second-guess himself and his actions, even as he is beinghailed in the media and in person as a hero and he is beingwholeheartedly supported by his wife, Lorraine Sullenberger (LauraLinney), via telephone from their California home.As the investigators (played by Mike O'Malley, Jamey Sheridan and AnnaGunn) repeatedly interview Sully and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (AaronEckhart), we hear information and arguments which will make most MovieFans question whether Sully made the right call and whether he reallyis a hero. As Sully alternately struggles with those same issues andreaffirms his version of events for the skeptical investigators, wealso see that short flight reenacted, from different perspectives andwith more and more of the story coming to light. We also get a taste ofthe media frenzy which surrounded Sully and his family, and seeflashback scenes of Sully's earlier experiences flying as a teenagerand in the military.The combination of the vast movie-making experience of Eastwood(directing his 35th feature) and Hanks (with over 30 years' worth offilms on his resume) has resulted in an interesting and well-conceivedtelling of Sully's experiences. Much like the NTSB investigation at thecenter of the story, the film uses what most of us didn't know aboutthe ""Miracle on the Hudson"" to dramatic effect, telling the untoldstory as if peeling back the layers of an onion. Besides a morecomplete picture of this incredible incident (and another reminder ofhow talented Eastwood and Hanks are), the film also gives us a subtlebut profound reminder that there is, and never will be, a substitutefor human experience, intuition and guts. ""Sully"" may not be athrill-a-minute movie, but it uses every one of its 95 minutes verywell. ""A-"""""
9,"""I had no idea all of these examinations of the competence, judgmentsand decisions of Sully were taking place behind the scenes as weregular folk out here were totally accepting of his heroicaccomplishment. Wow! Knowing that he had so much more to endure afterthe fact was absolutely fascinating. Again incredible kudos to ClintEastwood for another amazing film. The realism and authenticity ofvirtually every frame was awe inspiring. I felt like I was there forthe original experience. I guess we should expect nothing less thanthat from an Oscar winning director like Eastwood, but to do it timeand time again is remarkable."""
8,"""A refreshingly traditional true life tale directed by a traditionallyold school director, Sully has delivered Clint Eastwood his best filmin a number of years after a string of disappointments in the form offilms like Hereafter, J.Edgar and Invictus while the financiallysuccessful American Sniper was far from Eastwood's best and it's anaudience pleasing experience that will likely see it play some type ofpart in next year's Academy Awards.Taking a look at both the happenings and closely followed aftermath ofthe Miracle On The Hudson that saw pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenbergerand his co-pilot Jeff Skiles land an American Airlines flight with 155passengers on board on New York's Hudson river after a flock of birdscaused engine failures on the plane, Eastwood has within this tale ofhuman courage and lifesaving actions found a vehicle to not onlyshowcase an incredible tale of survival but a thrilling experience thatwill have you holding onto your cinema seat with a vice like grip.The initial trailers for Sully barely scratched the surface of theability Eastwood has enacted upon here as we are thrust between thefateful flight and Sully's fight to prove his decision was warrantedand the actual incident itself that is shown in numerous forms over thefilms 90 minute run time, each time offering us another point of viewto the occurrence on January 15th 2009. These scenes are Sully's bestand some of the most gripping scenes Eastwood has ever directed andwhile the outings outside of the doomed flight might not work to thesame level, Eastwood balances out the thrills with heart in outstandingfashion that often allows fellow veteran of the industry Tom Hanks timeto shine as well.Whilst appearing in great thrillers like Captain Philips and lastyear's magnificent Bridge of Spies, Hanks has had a rather topsy-turveydecade or so with his projects that has seen some fairly forgettableexperiences like Ithaca and Larry Crowne, but Sully provides theesteemed actor with a low-key yet worthy character that he makes hisown.Ably supported by his off-sider Aaron Eckhart as co-pilot Jeff Skiles,Hanks does some of his very best work as Captain Sully, who quicklybecomes a likable and relatable figure who after years of fine work inthe cockpit had to make a life and death decision in mere minutes thatfor various reasons become a scrutinised and publicly huge event. Itwould not be at all surprising to see Hanks figure as a major part ofSully's awards campaign.While it may be to slight for some and sections of the film veersomewhat towards the over dramatic (including a script that could'vedone with a little extra polish), Sully feels like a the type of bigHollywood film this year's movie event calendar has been sadly bereftof and marks another career win for the evergreen Eastwood and Hankswho here get to show the upstarts how a big budgeted drama is done,both in a set piece and storytelling point of view.4 Gran Torino billboards out of 5"""
9,"""Who else to pick to play US Airlines hero pilot Sullivan other than TomHanks, the theatrical Everyman of our generation? Henry Fonda did thissort of thing when I was a kid, but I was never a big Fonda guy. Hanksis fine as the modest but competent pilot excelling under extremepressure. This was a short movie, and rightfully so. The real drama isin the reenactment of the forced water landing (don't use the ""c"" word)which takes all of about 3 minutes in real time. But don't be surprisedwhen you don't see all the excitement up front. The screenplay,artfully done, doles out the thrills throughout the movie. So Hanks andEckhart are great as the pilots, the persons playing the NTSB officialsinvestigating the near-crash do a nice job although their attitude is alittle over the top. Even before reading a recent article about NTSBresponse to the movie, I was wondering if the NTSB's attitude was a bitoverplayed. This movie needed a couple of important lines to expressNTSB concern, including ""we are mandated to look at everything when aforced landing occurs, and discount the possibility of pilot error"";along with ""landing on the Hudson is a last choice, we have to fullyexplore whether the plane could have returned safely to the airport"".You don't get quite enough of that here. There is a difference betweena complete and thorough investigation and a witch-hunt; and we need tolook at possible pilot error not just for evaluating the pilots inquestion but as a learning experience for all pilots going forward. Butthe movie as it is plays out nicely, all the bells and whistles areout, and the scenes through the credits of the actual pilot andpassengers were much appreciated."""
1,"""This is a great movie. It's about a regular working-class guy who doessomething heroic. The movie is also about New York City. It showcasesNew York City at its best. Sully is the kind of movie that is so goodthat it can't help but put you in a good mood, and make you believethat decent, caring people are still out there. A pilot is flying aplane and when confronted with impending disaster maintains hisself-control resulting in a lot of lives being saved. Yet, what makesthe movie even more enjoyable are the qualities of the hero himself -modest, caring, loyal, and professional. The movie manages to make youcare about him as a person and in the process come to appreciate who heis and what he did. Tom Hanks warrants accolades for his fineperformance has Chessley Sullenberger. The rest of the cast isexcellent too. But as the title indicates, the story centers around oneman who showed the world true heroism in the fullest sense of theworld."""
1,"""The movie was very accurate especially with the Quick ReferenceHandbook. A lot of aviation movie like Left Behind are inaccurateespecially when a person who knows airplanes very well to watch. Thealarms and accurate, the cockpit was accurate, the Enchanced GroundProxity Warning System was accurate. There are humors here and there,but it is very very easy to understand the movie if you know a lotabout aviation. But overall, everyone should be able to understand theplot or movie unless you have completely no idea what happened to USair1549. Beware that they might be some misunderstanding parts in themovie but in the end you will still understand the movie well. I adviseto anyone who flies or loves aviation to watch this film cause it isprobably going to be the most accurate movie you ever gonna watch."""

8,"""MINOR SPOILERSWhen most people hear the name Captain Sully, they probably think""hero"", but ask him, or his family, and they'd describe him as aregular man. This film delves into his true feelings after the flight,and shows that for as much as he did for those people, he still felt asif he didn't deserve his praise. He felt that maybe the lawyers he wasfighting against were right, and he actually endangered the people onthat plane.We see that before the flight, Sully has has nightmares of almost thesame thing happening before, but in those dreams, he crashes intobuildings and dies, bringing many of the people on board with him. Heconstantly fears this loss of control in his plane, since it seems itis all he can truly control in his life. What does he say just beforethe engines go out in the real life incident? ""Life is better in theair"". He has probably thought about this many times, and this isprobably why he maintains such a calm attitude about it as it ishappening, as we see when we see the crash from the pilots' point ofview. But still, he doesn't want the fame, because part of him feels hedoesn't deserve it, no matter what everyone tells him. There is a greatshot of Sully jogging through the streets, as his shadow grows in thesmoke in front of him, and news reports of the crash can be heard inthe background, showing Sully running from this false image of himselfportrayed in the media.The film's structure revolves around his life after the flight, and hisstruggles with an insurance company working for the plane that waslanded into the river. There are many flashbacks and flash forwards,and we are able to see Sully as who he is: A man. We also get to seethe crash from first the point of view of the passengers, then thepilots. Some of the passengers are introduced swiftly to us, as thecamera glides from person to person, getting us to care just enough foreach one. Despite already knowing exactly what happens, these scenes ofthe planes crash are very intense. Since we know these people now, itis nerve wracking to see them put into such a near death experience.The camera gets shakier than usual, and you can tell the people don'tthink they are going to make it out alive. This makes it all the morealarming when we see how calm and collected Captain Sully is throughall of this. Also, for a film that should be inherently predictable, itsomehow remains unpredictable, specifically during the human flightsimulations.In the end, we realize that we place all of the credit for everyonecoming out OK on Sully, but in truth, it was everyone involved. If oneperson simply hadn't done their job, one person or more could've died.This includes the passengers, if they hadn't been smart, and stayedrelatively calm while listening to what they were told to do, theywould be dead. It was a miracle across the board that everyone turnedout alright."""
8,"""Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood. What a winning combination. Hanks asusual, is Hanksian. Clint is of course, the Man With No Name. Togetherthey give us the audience, a PG-13 version of 2012's Flight minus thenotions of alcoholism and vapid drug use. Their film is titled Sullyand excitedly, it is my latest review.Sully starts out mid-plot, starts out as non-linear, and feels a littledraggy (no pun intended). It then turns to aviation while switchinginto high gear. So far it is one of this year's best films, a harrowingtechnical achievement, a fascinating recreation of events in theweakest of our economic times.Now unless you've been living in a cave for the last seven years, you'dknow that Sully is based on a true story. Director Eastwood puts forththe behind the scenes stuff, the info you didn't get even though youmight have watched all the news coverage back in January of 2009. Soyeah, you probably know Sully's premise (a US Airways flight lands inthe Hudson River), you probably know its outcome (155 passengerssurvive), and yes, you probably know the protagonist's fate (Chesley""Sully"" Sullenberger is a hero, duh). It doesn't matter though. You'restill riveted for much of the way.In terms of overseeing the vision and being faithful to Sully's fact-based material, well Clint Eastwood looks more and more like an aginggenius everyday. He shoots this flick with a sense of lewd craft, asense of realism, and a numbing sense of profound proficiency. He putsyou the moviegoer, right in the middle of ""The Miracle on the Hudson""(and I mean literally in the middle of it). You wonder how he was ableto re-imagine two plane landing sequences (from two different points ofview) with such authenticity, such panache. It's powerful stuff whetheryou figure it out or not. Also in Sully, he effectively includes scenesof aircraft simulation that are part of Sullenberger's character'spublic hearing. Again he's adroit and seamlessly technological. He'sthat kind of filmmaker.Add the veritable Tom Hanks as the essential everyman playing ChesleySullenberger (Sullenberger is a more upper echelon everyman but stillan everyman) and you have a total winner with Sully. Yup, I plan onseeing it again. Rating: 3 and a half stars."""
8,"""Fall movie season kicks off with the extraordinary recounting of thetrue event known as the Miracle on the Hudson. Sully recounts the waterlanding through flashbacks and memories of Captain Chesley 'Sully'Sullenberger (Tom Hanks). Clint Eastwood directs this surprisinglyentertaining and emotionally movie film that will be tough competitionas we transfer into Oscar territory. Hanks is brilliant as the calm,yet self-doubting pilot, and gives Sully a charisma that this Americanhero deserves, especially in such troubling times.The visuals of the plan soaring over New York City with two enginessmoking. Eastwood puts audiences on the plane or as pedestrianonlookers as the plane declines reminding everyone of the tragic eventsthat happened nearly 8 years before. The timing of the release seemsplanned to pull at the heartstrings of American audiences and help usrealize the disaster that was avoided because of the quick thinking ofthe captain and the emergency crews in New York.I was unsure of how this movie would fill two hours and though it is alittle shorter than usual awards bait, every scene is important and atno point was I bored and found myself blinking away tears or on theedge of my seat for plenty of scenes throughout. The hearings pitcomputers versus man and Sullenberger is unyielding in his certaintythat he made the right decision, at least in public though he showsdoubts in his conversations with his wife, Lorraine Sullenberger (LauraLinney).Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"""

I will say tom hanks did a great job in the titlerole, since scully is not certain if he considers himself a hero butrather someone doing his job. It is also rather coincidental how thefilm was released 2 days before the 15th anniversary of 9/11 but thefilm shows how people can come together"""

Tom Hanks as Captain Sully recountthe events that led to that heroic landing on the Hudson River. Aninvestigation ensues and it boils down to computer simulations vs.human reaction and emotion. Always some agency trying to capitalize onsomeone's judgment, even if heroic.I highly recommend this masterpiece of film making and a bit of ahistory lesson here and something positive for New York City, since9/11. At just over an hour an a half in length, it makes for a perfectnight out at the movies. Oh btw, ignore that child-like, immature review by ""Turn Your WeaponsTo Snow"", giving this film a ""one"".This film and masterpiece is a well-deserved 10/10."""
7,"""Sully is based on what has popularly become known as the ""Miracle onthe Hudson"". For those in need of a refresher, on January 15, 2009,flight 1549 from New York City's LaGuardia airport to Charlotte, hit aflock of birds during its ascent, losing both of its engines. Findinglittle recourse, pilot Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and FirstOfficer Jeffrey Skiles made the fateful decision to make an emergencywater landing. They glided their A320 Airbus into the frigid waters ofthe Hudson River. There were 5 serious injuries but thankfully all 155passengers survived. Sully for his efforts was treated to a heroeswelcome.Much like the protagonist, the film is a lean, workman-like movie thatdoes it job, and does it amicably. The narrative bounces between POVrecollections of the crash and the immediate aftermath which includesSully (Hanks) and the rest of the crew shuttled between investigationsand press junkets. To up the psychological stakes, Sully is coercedinto second guessing himself by a National Transportation Safety Boardinvestigation (which act as the default bad guys) all while exhibitinglight symptoms of PTSD.Tom Hanks as our hero is yet again stellar playing a similar riff offthe Captain Phillips (2013) playbook. At this point, the man playingpersonable everyday heroes has made him a movie genre onto himself.He's not so much a born madcap swashbuckler but rather a working stiffwho always seems to be at the wrong place at the right time and relieson training and a breadth of experience to carry him through. As Sully,his inner turmoil as a guy more-or-less being blamed for doing theright thing, feels frightfully real.Director Clint Eastwood seems to take particular relish in conveyingstories of this nature. Sully is a pulse-pounding story of a red-blooded modern American hero. One who became lionized for doing hisjob. Yet instead of gravitating towards the limelight, Sullenbergerhumbly accepted his newfound hero pilot status while quietly butassuredly backing up his decision-making. Likewise the film doesn'ttake victory laps or pounds its chest like some other Clint Eastwooddirected film I can think of. Instead it lets the smart editing, clearand concise camera-work and nuts-and-bolts directing speak for itself.Unfortunately being a film resembling the clever terseness of JoeFriday can be a double-edged sword. Since it doesn't reach for thedramatic acme of Mystic River (2003) or the mythic majesty ofUnforgiven (1992), Sully does have the propensity to feel second- rate.Additionally the NTSB board push-back, which pits the gutsy pilotagainst simulations, reeks less of John Henry populism and more of aveiled criticism of egg-heads and their darn computers. I suppose mostfilms should have a villain and including Anna Gunn as the silentlycondescending adult in the room is a stroke of genius. But Sully'svisions mixed with the largely unspoken but always present specter of9/11 should have been enough to convey the stakes were plenty high onJanuary 15, 2009.Sully is a taut, well made B-movie that is occasionally tense andalways interesting. While it never reaches as high as it arguablyshould, it nevertheless makes for a fun time at the movies. The filmends with the real Captain Sully walking up to the plane fuselage whichsits at the Aviation Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. He embraces abunch of real 1549 passengers while centered on the screen and lightedlike a canonized saint. Any other true-life character I'd say Clint'slaying it on a bit thick, but this time I think I'll let it slide."""
8,"""Clint Eastwood comes back to our screens two years after AmericanSniper to tell us another American story. This time is the true storyof the US Airways flight 1549, which, on February 15, 2009, was forcedto land in the Hudson River after hitting several birds in the act oftaking off from New York's LaGuardia Airport. The movie is centered on the figure of the captain, Chesley ""Sully""Sullenberger, the hero that saved everyone on that plane by taking thedecision and then executing a bold water landing. In the movie, we gothrough the investigation of the accident and the struggles thatcaptain Sully faced during that period. The hero is then haunted bydoubts about himself and by the perspective of losing his pension after40 years of service. Telling a true story on screen is always tricky, but Sully deliverswith power every emotion, overcoming the fact that the viewer alreadyknows the outcome of the story. I've enjoyed the movie, I felt a widespectrum of emotions and it feels authentic. The actors are amazing andvery well directed, the dialogues are powerful, and Aaron Eckhartshould be forced to keep that glorious mustache till the end of time.Moreover, the narration of the events is very well designed, not givingus the scenes of big visual impact right away, but rather delivered,one bit at a time, in different moments of the movie. The only flaw of the movie itself is a piece of dialogue that gave mynerves. It appears to me that the old Clint wants to remind the viewersthat something else about planes crashing on New York happened in therecent past. Therefore, starting from the very first scene, we findimages of how worse that accident could have been. At first, Itolerated the choice, since it is fitting with a PSTD of the pilot.Moreover, it could be the way of the director to say ""everyone willthink about 9/11 anyway, just ride the elephant in the room"" (althoughI'm not sure about the first part and we will never know now). I ranout of tolerance when the issue was explicitly addressed with a phraselike ""It has been a while since New York had good news, especiallyinvolving planes"" (not a literal transposition). I found itinappropriate and it doesn't fit well in the movie.Besides that, it is a very well executed movie, I fully recommend itbecause it is a good way to spend a couple of hours.At last, I would like to address a message that the movie made me feeland to which I disagree with. The method used to represent theinvestigation, as well as the people whose duty is to establish whatwent wrong and who is responsible, made me take a stand against theinvestigation itself. This is simply a wrong message to deliver. Insuch accidents, the investigation is mandatory because you have also todecide if giving or not to the pilot (or the plane) theresponsibilities for other human lives. It is true that the struggleand the self-analysis of the main character are saying that he trustthe necessity of such investigation. However, from the choice of theactors (that always interpret annoying characters) to the dialogues,the feeling is that the investigators are the bad guys. I think this issimply the wrong message and I don't think that an expert director likeClint Eastwood did that by accident."""

Not very believable thatSully would have gotten any amount of the negative drama from hisfamily or others for such an effort but must've been necessary for thisto be more of a drama than a documentary, which would've been morepreferred. I would rather have watched this one at home since thefamiliarity of the story and the usual actors seem more appropriate forthe smaller, more intimate setting of a home theater.After you get out of the cockpit it's all waiting for the event withnifty flashbacks and second guesses as any well crafted airplaneadventure film can bring.CGI efforts are well within place as well as a decent score soattention is easily made to this work.I doubt I'd seen it in a theater for what it is, but if you have to getout of he house I can think of many worse films to avoid than this one."""

But, 'Sully', moves back and forth from theincident, and delves deeper into Sully's psychological & physicaljourney, once after the moment was over. It explores the side when hislife is invaded by reporters and investigators, who force Sully to puthis job, family, and reputation on the line. 'Sully' is a human-drama,treated with a tense touch. Also, the nerve-wracking airplane missionon the Hudson River, is repeated many times, but from differentperspectives. Its first shown as a nightmare following Sully, andlater, seen from the moment the birds hit the engines, and then fromthe some of the passengers & finally on how Sully & First OfficerJeffery Skiles, achieved the near-impossible. And not for once, does itfeel repetitive, in fact, the narrative digs deeper into that day &offers a wholesome view. Even the sequences where Sully & Skiies arequestioned by the investigators, are engrossing. In short, 'Sully'works from start to finish.Todd Komarnicki's Adapted Screenplay is Top-Notch. The Writing issuper-strong & delivers Sully's heroic story, with genuine drama &affecting human-conflict. There is not a single dull moment in the film& although there isn't much to think of the story behind a fewinstances, the Writer keeps the narrative straight to the point &razor-crisp. And Director Clint Eastwood is at top of his game! TheLegend handles 'Sully' with detail & passion. He's bought out the bestfrom its terrific cast & also allows his crew to soar, in everydepartment. 'Sully' is amongst his most accomplished works to date! Tom Stern's Cinematography is excellent. The entire airplane incident(Shot in IMAX), is brilliantly shot & executed. Even otherwise, Stern'sCamera-Work extracts the core emotions of its characters, at all times.Blu Murray's Editing is superb, as 'Sully' runs for a crisp 96-minutes.Art & Production Design are flawless. Christian Jacob & The TierneySutton Ban's Score is good. Performance-WIse: Tom Hanks Soars as 'Sully'. Hanks delivers amasterclass in subtlety, offering a personal & compelling performanceof a man, who was haunted by something, he didn't let go horriblywrong. He plays 'Sully' with a beating heart! Aaron Eckhart as JeffSkiles, is fantastic. Its such a joy to see this talented, underratedactor in such great form. Hanks & Eckhart share an infectious on-screencamaraderie & are the backbone of this solid film. Laura Linney asLorraine, Sully's wife, is restrained. Anna Gunn as Dr. ElizabethDavis, is brilliant.

8,"""It's a new weekend and that means a new wave of movies to flood thelocal theaters. Robbie K here starting the round with the latest dramabased on real life events that centers on an American Hero namedCaptain Sullenberger. Yes, I'm talking about Sully, the film that onceagain delves into whether or not the pilot who landed on the husband isindeed a hero or a delusional zero. So fasten your seatbelts, make sureyour trays are in the upright position, and cell phones off as we takeflight into my review.LIKES:  The Realism  The insight into Sully's mind  Tom Hanks actingWhen you look into a movie based on true events you hope there is moretruth than Hollywood fiction. Fortunately, this is one movie that putsreality before fantasy. Sully's 96 minute run time is a recreation ofthe treacherous nightmare that plagued the skies in 2009. Audiencemembers will be wowed as they are dropped into the cockpit of the USairline flight as it soars into the Hudson. The combination ofcamera-work and modern computer technology will immerse you into thefull experience, perhaps fooling you into thinking you are a passengeron the plane. In addition, the team manages to give you multipleperspectives of the flight, not only advancing the realism, but alsoadding more pieces to the proverbial puzzle. Yet, the other componentthat brings the realism is the airplane jargon that fills a majority ofthe dialogue. According to the retired pilot sitting next to me,Sully's writers were very accurate in the technology and maneuvers usedto land the plane. Will most care about this component? Probably not,but this reviewer appreciated the extra effort to make this movie real. What helps provide more answers to the mystery though is getting avisualization of Sully's internal thoughts. Much like a book, our teamwas able to illustrate the dark fears that plagued our captain as hewaits for the investigation to finish. These memories are well placedinto the story, helping to develop Sully while also helping advance theplot in a timely manner. Those who have read the tale and hoping themovie will mirror it are certain to enjoy this presentation, and thosewho choose a less literature based approach will find this methodentertaining and engaging. But of course the headliner of the movie is by far the legendary TomHanks playing Captain Sully. No surprise that Hanks is capable ofbringing this role to life. Hanks certainly commits to his role andmanages to mirror the reported personality of the Sully. His lines aredelivered with grade A accuracy, and yours truly gives the actor propsfor handling the lead role with such a powerful performance that willmost likely net him an Oscar. While most of the other cast certainlyplays a hand in recreating this story, Hanks is by far bearing thebrunt of the load and handles that responsibility quite well. DISLIKES:  The Drama Flare Added  Some perspectives not neededAs I sated, seldom is a movie safe from getting the dramatic touchadded to the tale. Sully is no exception as some components take onthat Hollywood magic to spice things up and make them more""entertaining."" Some of this editing is in the nature of the crashitself, the dragged out drop to the river, support personnel going intonear break downs to add a touch of sympathy, and even the ratherstretched portrayal of Sully's wife. Yet all those moments are nothingcompared to the direction they took the lead investigator CharlesPorter. Instead of playing an agent just looking into the entirescenario, Porter's character was like the lead marauder in a witch huntwith a single-minded goal to bring Sully down. This could have beenfine if this was the true character, or even if they mystery wasdeeper. Unfortunately, neither of these cases seem true, and Porter'sstubborn as a mule attitude inspired nothing more than anger and eyerolling for me. The second dislike comes in the form of editing and the director'sdecisions to split the incident into so many perspectives. While Iappreciate the integrated approach to fully envelop you into themoment, there were some components that really weren't necessary. Onemajor moment was from the civilian perspective watching the plane cometo land, or the random passenger trying to swim the cold waters due totheir panic. I appreciate the realism in all manners of this flight,but these moments added little to me other than trying to expand themovie out to a longer run time. A minor error sure, but the editingcould have been tapered down a bit to remove some of these pointlessmoments.The VERDICTWhen it comes to Sully, this reviewer has to give props to this movie.A realistic portrayal of the hero with fantastic acting and attentionto detail are sure to attract the nonfiction lovers to the theaters forthis one. Sure it could have found a home on Netflix or PBS as a 1 hourspecial, but I have to admit that this movie was one of the betterproductions I've seen in a while. So is it worth a trip to the theater?I would say yes, especially to pay tribute to Hanks' wonderfulperformance. The recommended audience is anyone in love withnonfiction/true stories, Tom Hanks fans, or those looking for anothertale of a trip gone wrong (with Hanks again being the captain. Guess Iwon't be traveling with him anytime soon.)My scores are: Biography/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0"""
8,"""Sully is a timely movie. Watching it makes one feel proud to be part ofhumanity and, on the eve of September 11, relieved to know that not allplanes flying in the vicinity of New York's skyscrapers have evilintentions behind them. Here is a true story about a passenger airlinerin trouble, the pilot delivers an improbable landing on water thatresulted in no fatalities. The air crew and passengers are cooperativeand live to tell their miraculous near- death escapade. The air trafficcontrollers tried everything they could to avert any disaster. Thefirst responders were quick on the scene and so efficient that therescue mission was completed under an hour. And happily, no politiciantried to claim credit or steal the thunder from these true heroes. TomHanks is solid as always, this time as the calm, composed, almostunassuming pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. It may not be a showyrole but Hanks nails every moment, from that of making firmsplit-second decisions to those of quiet thoughtful ones. DirectorClint Eastwood takes us behind the scenes of this real-life drama, fromwhat was happening within the plane to the interrogation of the pilotand co-pilot by officials, providing moments of tension throughout themovie. Even if this story is familiar to the viewer, it is still greatto be reminded of how wonderful it feels when everyone involved playshis part and does the right thing. Thanks, Mr Eastwood, for a moviethat is not only timely, but timeless."""
8,"""(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A bio-pic that tells its story concisely but lacks a realemotional lift-off.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: The true story of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's emergencywater landing and its aftermath. JIM'S REVIEW: Everyone needs a hero and Sully is the latest bio-picabout an American idol. The story is well known, as is the outcome, butas directed by Clint Eastwood, the film immerses the moviegoer in abehind-the-scenes glimpse of Sully's saga. In January 2009, thisordinary man successfully crash-landed his plane into the Hudson River,saving all 155 lives on board. We witness this ""Miracle on the Hudson"",and view the event both before and after the crash, or as Sully calledit, ""an emergency water landing"". Although the filmmakers smartly stagethe crash in multiple scenes via flashbacks and dream sequences, itlands squarely on the dramatic after-effects that haunt this aviator.As Sully and his crew are subjected to a thorough investigation by theFederal Transportation Safety Board, who become the film heavies inthis movie, the film takes flight, even if it treads too lightly on itssubject. Played by Tom Hanks, in common man mode, the film aligns us to our herofrom the start. From a competent screenplay by Todd Komarnick, which isbased on Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's own autobiography, there is animbalance of the facts by Mr. Eastwood that biases our judgment andplaces the moviegoer in direct support of Sully and his actions,without naturally questioning his decision-making process. (One wondersif many passengers were injured or died during this crash if the samepublic reaction would have happened. So to paint the FTSB as the fallguys isn't very fair or logical. It is, after all, the procedure thatoccurs with any aviation incident. However the doubt factor, flightsimulations, and conjecture of the inquiry does make for good conflictand compelling personal drama.)Solidly directed by Mr. Eastwood, the film is very well-crafted. TheCGI is effectively done. The acting by Mr. Hanks and Aaron Eckhart asSully's co-pilot, is strong. Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan, Mike O'Malley,and an underused Laura Linney as Sully's wife are all fine in theirsupporting roles.Yet, emotionally, the film seemed to be stuck in auto-pilot for thisreviewer, a disconnect with the characters' traumatic circumstances.The narrative structure doesn't follow a linear structure and hasissues with a choppiness as it jumps from the aftermath to the accidentitself and then back to Sully's past life. The episodic script neverquite lands, causing an aloofness in its clinical retelling. The manyplane crash sequences, shown from varying points of view, are overdone,serving as pure filler. While the film successfully establishes the personal tension of theinvestigation quite effectively, it underplays the dramatic gravitas.Were more of the screen time spent on this conflict, the film couldhave been more directly involving. Less time spent on the actual impact(of the plane) and more time spent on the personal stakes from theresults of plane crash would have been more powerful for thismoviegoer.Still, Sully shows a vivid portrait of a nice guy, humble to a fault,who was thrust into a dire life-and-death situation and survived totell his tale. Mr. Eastwood honors him and the first emergencyresponders admirably. But depicting the man as less of a saint and moreof a human being could have made this film more believable andthoroughly engaging. Yes it's a riveting and uplifting story but thefilm plays it too safe, looking for that soft place to land.NOTE: There is a lovely song written by Mr. Eastwood, called FlyingHome, during the end credits.

1,"""From the very beginning I was impressed with picture. There are a lotof beautifully composed scenes.Despite it is not an action movie, it keeps tension growing all thetime. I felt like my guts were winded onto rusty piece of iron in somemoments.You'll not get bored, you have a compassion to protagonists. The castis brilliant.Despite there were some mistakes and stupid things, and Sully's wifecharacter behaves idiotically in some scenes (maybe something was lostin translation during full dubbing in localized version), I still givethis movie 10 out of 10.Worth every penny!"""
NA,"""This is without a doubt the most offensive, disgusting movie I haveever seen. I cannot believe this GARBAGE is being shown in theaters.""Sickening"" is the word I would use to describe this movie. What anabsolute disgrace. The makers of this film should be brought up oncharges. They don't have a shred of decency or any respect foranything, obviously. The tragic events depicted in this movie areburned into our collective consciousness; for the monstrous director ofthis film to lone his pockets with the blood money of a national trgedyis beyond despicable. The families of the victims deserve far betterthan this abomination, and I hope they are successfully able to sue andget everyone involved on this disgraceful film thrown in prison forlife. Horrible offensive disgusting bad movie."""
1,""". . . that we MUST elect someone such as Leader Trump in November torevamp our Education and Transportation Systems. In his masterful,ROSHOMON-like hit movie SULLY, Eastwood examines the title characterfrom every angle. Though Trump University's B.S. in Aviation REQUIRESwould-be airline pilots to study John Wayne's example in THE HIGH ANDTHE MIGHTY, as well as Leslie Nielsen's character in AIRPLANE!,Eastwood portrays a Chesley Sullenberger who jogs around in front oftaxis, whiles away the hours at bars, and NEVER sees a flick! Wayne's""Whistling Dan"" co-pilot has to slap around his boss Robert Stack toprevent a mid-flight water ditching when Stack goes all SULLY on him(in a scene which is later famously reprised--18 times--in AIRPLANE!).But since Chesley skips Trump U., he and his culturally illiteratecohorts have no one to slap THEM around! The only silver lining is thatjust a trashy Airbus is lost by SULLY. Leader Trump has pledged tooutlaw this sort of cheap foreign vehicle, unable to withstandencounters with rugged American Wild Life. So come next Jan. 20, itwill be good riddance to Toyota, Mercedes, and Airbus!"""
9,"""Film Meaning Specialists focus on ""meaning"" or the ""moral in thestory"". Good films typically have high levels of meaning for audiences.Our job is to extract that meaning out so you get as much value fromwatching a film as possible.We identified 11 core meanings within Sully. Some messages are moresignificant than others, but all of them worth commenting on.** Spoiler Alert: Film meanings require a description of the plot andfilm outcomes to contextualise. If you want to be surprised by a film,read this after a film. If you want to be enlightened by a film, readit before watching it. **Message #1: Distraction is dangerousAt the start of the film, Sully is jogging, his mind full of thoughtsand concerns. He is almost killed (run over) by a cab (taxi) driver. Heis unharmed, but it could have been a serious accident. In ""Me BeforeYou"", the central character crossed the road distracted and was hit bya motorcycle. He ended up disabled and flew to Europe to commitassisted suicide. Moral: When you are distracted you are in danger. Payattention.Message #2: Sensational stories create overwhelming media attentionSully landing safely on water with none of the 155 in the plane dyingwas unheard of. In fact, before the landing, it's obvious that waterlandings mean death to everyone on the plane. The sensational nature ofthis story creates media attention that is overwhelming for Sully andhis family. The degree of attention increases as time progresses.Moral: Once in the media spotlight for something significantlynewsworthy, expect the spotlight to brighten to overwhelming levels.Message 3: Keep going and maintain focusSully has a flashback to when he was young. He receives sage advice,""Never forget that no matter what is happening fly the air plane.""Moral: No matter how problematic things get, keep focus on what you aredoing, and keep going. Don't panic, get distracted or give up. Don'tstop. Keep going.Message 4: Life's work at risk from 1 actionIf Sully was investigated and found negligent, it would mean that hisconsulting business and his profession as a pilot would be over. Notonly that he would lose his pension and be fired immediately. Moral:Sometimes we face events that could destroy our future. See whathappens. It may not be as bad as you think.Message 5: Be committedSully was the last off the plane, painstakingly checking that everyonewas safely evacuated. Moral: Commitment is doing your job from thestart to the finish without gaps in between.Message 6: Are all 155 accounted for?Sully needed to know all 155 were safe as survivors were taken bymultiple ferries to multiple locations. Moral: Know what you areaccountable for.Message 7: Last one on the rescue boatSully was the last one on the rescue boat due to his commitment(Message 5) and accountability (Message 6). Moral: When you are aleader commitment and accountability are how you show leadership.Message 8: When facing death, the 1st call is to familyWhen people thought they were going to die they reached out to theirfamilies and loved ones. They didn't call their work and say they maynot be in tomorrow. Moral: What really matters becomes obvious in timesof crisis but is often ignored in good times. Reach out and let theones you love know them before a crisis. Message 9: Question the evidenceA brilliant message was how Sully refuted ""evidence"" that if leftunchallenged would have seen his life fall to pieces (Message 4). Hequestioned the evidence, found it lacking for numerous reasons andcreated reasonable doubt. His attack on the validity of the evidencesaved his career. Moral: When people use evidence against you, refuteit based on logic, fairness and reasonableness.Message 10: Exert control: I need a quick breakSully exerted control. In a room full of what looked to be 100 peoplewhere he was being questioned in an adversarial way. He said, ""I need aquick break"" and left the room with his copilot. He was letting thegravity and weight of the refuted evidence impact the people judginghim. It was a masterful stroke of negotiating. Moral: In an adversarialencounter find a way to take control and slow down or stop theattacking side's momentum.Message 11: Share creditAt the end of the film Sully is found to have acted in with the highestpossible skills levels. A previously adversarial opponent, becomes asupporter and praises Sully as the only reason that the 155 peoplelived. Sully refutes that and shares all the credit with his co-pilot,the stewardesses, the crew, the many rescuers and more. Moral: Victory,nor defeat, is never ours alone. Many people are involved. Share creditlavishly - because that is real.Ken Standfield is a film meaning specialist who explores and shares theideas, concepts, morals and messages in films to assist audiences getthe maximum value possible out of the investment they make in watchingmovies.

1,"""Firstly, a plane like that would have exploded when it hit the waterand everyone would have died.Secondly, this is a very boring movie. This has a lot of unneeded talking and everyone is rude to Tom Hanks'character for no reason.He saved everyone but everyone hates him..? Uh? The script clearlyneeded more rewrites because it does not make sense.Overall, a boring movie. Pure Oscar bait. Nothing more.I do not recommend it. You should see something else this weekend.1/10."""
